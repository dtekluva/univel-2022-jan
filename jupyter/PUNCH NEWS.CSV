Buhari lifted Twitter suspension 'because elections are here' - Jonathan's ex-aide  Omokri,https://punchng.com/buhari-lifted-twitter-suspension-because-elections-are-here-jonathans-ex-aide-omokri/,   Victoria Edeme  Published 13 January 2022  Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, on Thursday posited that the lifting of the Twitter suspension in Nigeria by the Federal Government was due to the forthcoming 2023 general elections. Omokri, who was an appointee under the Goodluck Jonathan administration said this via a series of tweets on his page, claiming that Nigeria lost $750 million because of the Twitter ban. He tweeted, “$750 million. In case you are wondering, that is exactly what Nigeria lost in 222 days of banning Twitter. “So, if anybody is telling you that Nigeria won with the #TwitterBan, ask them to tell you what exactly Nigeria won. Nigeria lost big time!  “The claim that Twitter agreed to allow Buhari’s junta regulate Twitter users in Nigeria is as fakes as Buhari’s integrity. “The expectation that Twitter would move from Ghana to Nigeria will never happen. Twitter did not beg. Buhari bulged because elections are here!” The Federal Government had suspended Twitter operations in the country on June 5, 2021, about 222 days ago.

However, an official statement on Wednesday revealed that the suspension has been lifted. According to the statement, the Federal Government asked Twitter to meet up with some conditions before the removal of the ban, and the social media company has agreed to the conditions, with the execution of the agreement starting this week.

UPDATED: It's shameful for Buhari  Garba Shehu  others to return to Twitter —Activists,https://punchng.com/updated-its-shameful-for-buhari-garba-shehu-others-to-return-to-twitter-activists/,   Kayode Oyero  Published 13 January 2022  A human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, says it is shameful for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and members of his regime to return to microblogging site, Twitter after suspending the social media platform for over seven months. The founder of the civic group, Concerned Nigerians, in a chat with The PUNCH on Thursday, described the Twitter ban as an anti-democratic and unconstitutional act in the first place. Also, activist David Hundeyin said Buhari has succeeded in massaging his ego for over seven months since he suspended the micro-blogging platform on June 4, 2021. He said, “The removal of the ban itself is not unexpected, because regardless of the Buhari regime’s posturing over the past seven months, it is in fact Twitter that always had the bargaining position. Nigeria needs Twitter and not the other way around. We have wasted seven months of our time as a nation pursuing an imaginary outcome against a global tech giant with a market cap bigger than Nigeria’s annual federal budget.”  The Buhari regime had suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria on June 4, 2021, after the micro-blogging platform deleted a controversial civil war post by the President. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had said the “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence”. According to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool, Nigeria’s economy lost N104.02m ($250,600) every hour to the ban on Twitter as of December 2021. The regime, however, said it has lifted the suspension, effective January 13, 2022.          Though the President has not tweeted since the lifting of the ban, his spokesman, Garba Shehu; Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, amongst other members of the cabinet have resumed tweeting. But Adeyanju said it is shameful for members of the regime to return to the social media platform after suppressing free speech. Read Also Garba Shehu under fire over first post after Twitter returnsNigeria better with conditions met, Keyamo returns to TwitterTwitter reacts as operations resume in Nigeria after 222 days' suspension  He said, “It is indeed shameful for President Buhari, Garba Shehu and others to return to Twitter after subverting the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the Twitter Ban and returning to the same platform they denied Nigerians from using for many months. The ban had no place in law and was a clear violation of section 39 rights of Nigerians. “The Twitter ban in the first place is an anti-democratic act, it is unconstitutional, has no basis in law because our constitution has made explicit provision that Nigerians have the right to express themselves and have the right to hold opinion and receive information. So, the ban was a contravention of the rights of Nigerians on social media, especially on Twitter.” The activist also said the ban and its lifting have already portrayed Nigeria in bad light among the comity of nations, adding that the development would affect the human rights index of the country. “There should not only be freedom of speech but freedom after speech,” he said. Nigeria has over 33 million active social media users. WhatsApp is the most popular platform used in the country, with over 90 million users according to Statista. About 61.4 per cent of Nigerian social media users use Twitter, 86.2 per cent use Facebook, 81.6 per cent use YouTube, 73.1 per cent use Instagram, and 67.2 per cent use Facebook Messenger.

FG should pay youth entrepreneurs every kobo lost to Twitter ban –Lawyer,https://punchng.com/fg-should-pay-youth-entrepreneurs-every-kobo-lost-to-twitter-ban-lawyer/,   Kayode Oyero  Published 13 January 2022  An Abuja-based human rights lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, says there is nothing to rejoice over on the lifting on suspension placed on micro-blogging site Twitter by the Federal Government. According to the lawyer, Twitter is beyond a social media platform but a money-making avenue for Nigerian youths who eke a living through content creating and sharing on the platform. “Local digital communications firms and ingenuous Nigerian youths earn a living from the use of Twitter to post communications on behalf of their clients. Others who may not afford physical stores also rely on Twitter to give visibility to their products and services. “But hundreds of youths lost this means of livelihood to the unjustifiable suspension of Twitter by the Federal Government in the last seven months,” Olajengbesi said in a statement on Thursday just as the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) announced that it has lifted the suspension on Twitter.  The Buhari regime had suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria on June 4, 2021, after the micro-blogging platform deleted a controversial civil war post by the President. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had said the “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence”. According to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool, Nigeria’s economy lost N104.02m ($250,600) every hour to the ban on Twitter as of December 2021. Olajengbesi, who is the Managing Partner of Law Corridor in Abuja, therefore said, “The Federal Government should pay Nigerian youths and business owners who lost means of livelihood due to the seven-month suspension of Twitter in the country.

With Nigeria’s unemployment rate almost hitting 40 per cent, a government that cannot provide jobs for millions of employable youths yet cut off their means of livelihood is far from working in the interest of the citizens. “The Buhari government must learn how to live with Nigerians and not adopt punitive measures as a tool of vengeance to inflict pain on Nigerians and violate the fundamental human rights of citizens.” Nigeria had about 33 million active social media users as of January 2021.

Shehu had tweeted midnight that Nigeria gained “immeasurably” from the shutdown of Twitter when the Nigerians tackled him. He posted, “Welcome back – Let me join fellow countrymen and women in welcoming the resolution of the impasse between the Federal Government of Nigeria and Twitter Inc., leading to the laying of a “foundation for a mutually beneficial future with endless possibilities. “I join the leaders of government in appreciating all Nigerians, “especially the vibrant Nigerian youths who have borne with the long wait to resolve this impasse,” and as the government statement clearly says, the gains made from this shared national sacrifice are immeasurable.  “We hope that this is appreciated by all. The nation comes first. Once again, welcome back!” Reacting, the Nigerians asked Garba Shehu to state the gains of Twitter suspension. One of them, Onu’kwube @RayNkah, said, “‘Welcome back’? No. We didn’t go anywhere. We’ve always been here. Speak for yourself.”          Sir Ted @Deus_Ugwoke: Which impasse are you talking about, the unfortunate ban was unnecessary in the first place, we know it’s a race against time for the APC government knowing the election campaign will be around the as Twitter plays a major role for the campaign.

He stated this in his first tweet on Thursday after the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), lifted the suspension on Twitter after over seven months. “For those who prioritised politics over patriotism and exhibited disingenuous righteousness on Twitter suspension, they can now see that with all the FG conditions to which Twitter agreed, Nigeria is eventually better off for it. Congratulations Nigeria,” Keyamo wrote. Twitter had deleted a controversial civil war post by Buhari in June 2021.  Consequently, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who had accused Twitter of double standards, announced the suspension of the microblogging site on June 4, 2021, citing the “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence”. According to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool, Nigeria’s economy lost N104.02m ($250,600) every hour to the ban on Twitter as of December 2021.

Bayelsa to clamp down on illegal refinery operators from Rivers,https://punchng.com/bayelsa-to-clamp-down-on-illegal-refinery-operators-from-rivers/,   Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa  Published 13 January 2022  Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has warned operators of illegal refineries who are planning to relocate to the state as a result of the ongoing clampdown in neighbouring Rivers State to steer clear of Bayelsa. According to him, the state cannot afford to also be polluted by soot as had been the situation in Rivers which was traced to illegal bunkering popularly called ‘kpo fire’. Diri, who gave the warning when he received his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, at the Government House in Yenagoa, lamented the impact of crude oil production activities by operators on the ecosystem. He said it was unacceptable for people to destroy the environment while the international oil companies were continually blamed for the same reason.  The governor, therefore, warned operators escaping from Rivers to Bayelsa to go elsewhere as his administration had set up a standing committee to arrest and prosecute anyone caught in the illicit business. He said, “Whatever that happens in Rivers State is transported down here (Bayelsa). We have intelligence that most of them (operators of illegal refineries) want to move to Bayelsa.

We have moved on.          “Anyone who is planning to leave Rivers State to come and start that illicit, illegitimate, illegal business in Bayelsa State, please, have a change of mind and look elsewhere because we already have a standing committee on that from our state security council meeting and we will come down very hard on anyone that will do that illegal and illegitimate business in Bayelsa.” Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

US sanctions five North Koreans after missile launch,https://punchng.com/us-sanctions-five-north-koreans-after-missile-launch/,   Agency Report  Published 13 January 2022  The United States imposed sanctions Wednesday on five North Koreans linked to the country’s ballistic missile program, a day after Pyongyang carried out what it said was the launch of a hypersonic missile. The Treasury Department said the five North Koreans being sanctioned were “responsible for procuring goods for the DPRK’s (North Korea’s) weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile-related programs.” “Today’s actions, part of the United States’ ongoing efforts to counter the DPRK’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, target its continued use of overseas representatives to illegally procure goods for weapons,” Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement. The latest launches “are further evidence that it continues to advance prohibited programs despite the international community’s calls for diplomacy and denuclearization,” Nelson said.  North Korean state media reported on Wednesday that the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, personally oversaw the successful test of the hypersonic missile, the second such launch by the nuclear-armed nation in less than a week. State news agency KCNA said the most recent test demonstrated “the superior manoeuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle.” It claimed it hit a target some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) away.

The Treasury Department said one of the North Koreans being sanctioned, Choe Myong Hyon, was based in Russia and had provided support to North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS), which is already subject to sanctions. Also targeted were four China-based North Korean representatives of SANS-subordinate organizations, the Treasury Department said: Sim Kwang Sok, Kim Song Hun, Kang Chol Hak and Pyon Kwang Chol. In a related action, Treasury said the Department of State had designated another North Korean, O Yong Ho, a Russian national, Roman Anatolyevich Alar, and a Russian company, Parsek LLC, for having “materially contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery by (North Korea).” The Treasury move prohibits any dealings by US nationals with the designated individuals and foreign companies that engage with them could also be subject to sanctions.

Daramola, a former House of Representatives member representing Ekiti North I, who said Bamidele’s governorship ambition in APC was a legitimate demand, noted that the Senator’s contributions surpassed those of other aspirants seeking the party’s ticket. The former Fayemi campaign DG, who spoke in Ado Ekiti while formally joining Bamidele to ensure his emergence as a candidate in the January 27 APC primary, described the Senator as the right man for the top job, taking cognisance of his contributions to APC.  He described him as “a man of history in Ekiti progressive fold that nobody could erase.” “To me and those of us who understand the history of APC in Ekiti, Senator Bamidele’s aspiration is a legitimate demand, because he has paid his dues. Considering where we are today, we should allow him to succeed Governor Fayemi.

Let us support the person that knows the way, there is imminent danger ahead of us if we miss it,” Daramola said.          Bamidele assured on the occasion that many strong politicians would still join his structure like Daramola did, adding that many Ekiti eminent sons and daughters were desirous of joining his campaign train to ensure a new breath of life in the state.

Rising from their emergency meeting in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State on Wednesday, the groups drawn from the 11 states in the South-South and South-East, said the minister has all the credentials to succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2023.

According to him, it was time the electorates “rose above petty sentiments of ethnicity, nepotism and other discriminatory factors to sustain the tempo of developments as engineered by President Buhari since 2015.

Twitter reacts as operations resume in Nigeria after 222 days' suspension,https://punchng.com/twitter-reacts-as-operations-resume-in-nigeria-after-222-days-suspension/,   Sodiq Oyeleke  Published 13 January 2022  Nigerians can now access their Twitter accounts without using Virtual Private Network (VPN) – 222 days after the Federal Government suspended the operations of the social media giant. Though the Nigerian government announced that Twitter operations will be restored at 12.00 am on Thursday, January 13, it did not. Twitter remained inaccessible in Lagos as of 12:30 am when our correspondent visited the microblogging website. However, at 4.05 am, the social media platform was accessible.  Announcing its official return, Twitter assured the Nigerian government of its commitment of driving civic participation. It posted, “We are pleased that Twitter has been restored for everyone in Nigeria. Our mission in Nigeria and around the world, is to serve the public conversation. We are deeply committed to Nigeria, where Twitter is used by people for commerce, cultural engagement, and civic participation. “We’re committed to integrating diverse perspectives that make our service better for everyone.”          The PUNCH had reported that the Federal Government ended its suspension of Twitter, seven months after banning the social media giant in a dispute over a tweet by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Nigeria halted Twitter operations in June after the company deleted a comment by Buhari, provoking an international outcry over freedom of expression. The government and Twitter have been in negotiations since over restoring the service based on a set of conditions, including Twitter registering its operations in Nigeria. Read Also UPDATED: It's shameful for Buhari, Garba Shehu, others to return to Twitter —ActivistsGarba Shehu under fire over first post after Twitter returnsAfter 222 days, Buhari lifts Twitter ban  “The Federal Government of Nigeria directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari… has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12am tonight,” a statement from the country’s information technology development agency said on Wednesday. The ban shocked many in Nigeria, where Twitter had a major role in political discourse, with the hashtags #BringBackOurGirls after Boko Haram kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls in 2014, and #EndSARS during anti-police brutality protests in 2020. Earlier, Nigerian officials had also criticised Twitter for deleting Buhari’s comment while accusing the platform of allowing activities that threatened the country’s existence. That was a reference to social media remarks by separatist agitators from the country’s southeast, where a civil war five decades ago killed one million people.           Twitter deleted a comment when Buhari had referenced Nigeria’s civil war, in the context of a warning to those responsible for recent unrest in the country’s southeast. After the ban, officials also referenced then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s support for the #EndSARS protests last year in Nigeria against police brutality. About 40 million people or around 20 percent of Nigeria’s population have a Twitter account, according to AFP, and many use the platform for business. Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

2023: I didn't endorse any presidential aspirant  says Soyinka,https://punchng.com/2023-i-didnt-endorse-any-presidential-aspirant-says-soyinka/,   Gbenga Adeniji  Published 13 January 2022  Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, has distanced himself from a viral post linking him to the endorsement of the presidential ambition of a former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. The elder statesman in a statement on Wednesday titled, “Season of Fakery Galore,” described the authors of the post as illiterate public interlopers who lacked the courage of their conviction and must steal identities of their betters. The post, embedded with the pictures of Soyinka and Tinubu, went viral on the Internet last November and quoted Soyinka as saying, “I have never involve myself in politics or campaign for any politician but in 2023 I will involve in politics and campaign for longtime friend in 1993 NADECO struggle. Nobel laurel, Professor Wole Soyinka.” The post returned to public space after Tinubu on Monday said that he had declared his intention to run for presidency in 2023 to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd).  Soyinka said, “Here we go again. The same boring, illiterate public interlopers who lack the courage of their conviction and must steal the identities of their betters. One can only hope that the public has learnt to identify Fake News and join in the urgent task of exposing and disgracing these despicable touts. “For the avoidance of doubt, I have not even thought 2023, much less inserted candidates into coveted positions.

Complaints as University of Abuja increases school fees,https://punchng.com/complaints-as-university-of-abuja-increases-school-fees/,   Deborah Tolu-Kolawole and Solomon Odeniyi, Abuja  Published 13 January 2022   Some students of the University of Abuja on Wednesday in separate interviews with The PUNCH lamented the decision of the school authorities to increase their tuition fees. This is as some of the students took to popular micro-blogging platform, Twitter, to lament the increment which was described as both ”unfair” and  ”unjust” in protest. According to a student who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, some of them had been struggling to gather money for payment of the former fees due to the economic situation in the country but were shocked to learn of the new hike in fees. “Some of us are still struggling to make sure that our fees are complete and then we heard of the increment. There is economic hardship in this country. Where do they expect us to get the money to pay? Some of the people who spoke to the Vice Chancellor said the school explained that they needed money to construct some buildings; who will use the buildings if we cannot pay our school fees?” Another student also lamented the constant increment in fees which she claimed was also experienced in 2020. “The fees were increased in 2020. The funny thing is that new students have two weeks to pay. This is a federal university and not a private school, why is the school always increasing its fees? A student who also lamented his plight on Twitter via @akashi68 said, “Third time in a row, University of Abuja has and continues to increase school fees, adding 10k to every session, I paid 27k later paid 37k, now it is 47k”.  But the spokesperson for the university, Dr. Habib Yakoob, when contacted by our correspondent, explained that the increment was a slight one. He explained that the university could no longer depend on the government for funds. He said, “The increment is not that significant; it was a slight increment but you see, no matter what anybody says, there would not be enough justification for why it is increased because even one kobo might not be affordable for our students. So, we sympathise with them but do remember that even some of our lecturers and other members of staff also have their children here, So, everybody is involved.  “The University of Abuja is driving towards being a world-class university; a lot of developments have been taking place. We cannot also rely on the government for funds for the good things that the vice chancellor, the university management will want to carry out. So many projects and development are going on. So, with all of these, it requires some money and everybody is being taxed, not only the students. And it is just a slight review. There were consultations, it is not that the vice chancellor just woke up and decided to increase the fees,” he said.  Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

Hushpuppi: AGF  police  anti-extradition group shun suit on Abba Kyari,https://punchng.com/hushpuppi-agf-police-anti-extradition-group-shun-suit-on-abba-kyari/,   Friday Olokor  Published 13 January 2022  A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Wednesday, fixed February 10 for the hearing of a suit seeking to stop the Nigeria Police Force and the Attorney-General of the Federation from arresting and extraditing a suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari. Justice Donatus Okorowo fixed the date following the absence of the plaintiff, the Incorporated Trustees of the Northern Peace Foundation and the two defendants, the NPF and the AGF, in court. Although the suit was slated for mention before a new judge, Justice Okorowo, none of the parties showed up in court and were also not represented by legal practitioners. Shortly after the suit was called and no lawyer announced appearance for the applicant and the respondents, the judge inquired from the court registrar who the plaintiff was and he was told Kayode Ajulo.  The judge said since the case was transferred to his court, the respondents had not been served as there was no proof of service in the court records. According to him, it is either the applicant has lost interest in the matter or has abandoned it. Justice Okorowo, however, said since the matter was coming for the first time before him, he would prefer to give the applicant till February 10 to be in court to prosecute the suit.

The ITNPF had through its team of lawyers, led by Ajulo, on August 19, 2021 argued an ex parte application asking the court to stop any planned arrest or extradition of Kyari to the United States of America by the defendants pending the hearing and final determination of the substantive suit. However, after carefully listening to the lawyer, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, who was handling the suit at the time, refused to grant the request to stop Kyari’s arrest and extradition through ex parte means. Kyari was indicted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigations in an alleged multi-million naira fraud said to have been perpetrated by a Nigerian citizen, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi.

Diri gave the directive during the State Executive Council meeting at the Government House, Yenagoa, on Wednesday, explaining that such an ambition was legitimate but it should not be at the expense of effective service delivery of his administration. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Gov Diri asks appointees eyeing elective offices to resign’, issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Daniel Alabrah. The governor said that although 2022 is a political year, governance will not be sacrificed on the altar of politics.  He noted that the administration still had time to deliver on its promises before the next governorship election in late 2023.

Diri, however, commended members of the Exco for their commitment to service of the state in the past year and expressed the confidence that working together they can do more for the people.

What else can we still do as we still have time to still do more? The feedback from the people about our performance so far has been very encouraging.” “However, let me warn that any member of the state executive council that has one political ambition or the other to honourably resign.

Olubadan: We’ll revert to our former positions as high chiefs  says Balogun,https://punchng.com/olubadan-well-revert-to-our-former-positions-as-high-chiefs-says-balogun/,   Olufemi Olaniyi  Published 13 January 2022  The Otun Olubadan, Senator Lekan Balogun, has said he and his colleagues who were promoted to Obas by the previous administration will revert to their original positions of High Chiefs as directed by the state governor, Seyi Makinde. The Otun Olubadan, who is the next in line to become the new Olubadan, said this in an interview with our correspondent in Ibadan on Wednesday. Makinde had on Tuesday directed that Ibadan traditional institution revert to its original concept to end the controversy trailing the selection of the new Olubadan after the death of Oba Saliu Adetunji. Balogun said, “We are okay by the governor’s directive. He is the one running the government. Whatever he wants is what we will do. He means well for the state, for Ibadan and others. We will abide by his demand.  “We will abide by what he said. It was the rule of his predecessor that got us to do what we were doing and now that he is in charge and he wants us to revert, we will revert. “Whatever he wants is what we will abide by. We lose nothing by doing that and that is the way it is.” There has been raging controversy over the propriety of the Otun Olubadan to ascend the throne of Olubadan after the death of Oba  Adetunji.          He and other High Chiefs were elevated to beaded crown-wearing Obas by the administration of Senator Abiola Ajimobi but the Osi Olubadan, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, who is a former governor in the state, rejected the offer to become an Oba. Following the death of Oba Adetunji, a former Attorney General in the state, Mr Michael Lana, in a petition to the governor, asked him to withhold approval for the Otun Olubadan to ascend the throne of Olubadan. Read Also Olubadan: Ladoja absent again as kingmakers meet, Balogun confidentMakinde breaks silence, reveals how next Olubadan will emergeLadoja absent as kingmakers meet to ratify Lekan Balogun as Olubadan  He argued that the High Chiefs had been elevated to Obas and it would be an aberration to crown somebody twice because such had never happened anywhere in Yorubaland. But the High Chiefs said their elevation could not stop any of them from ascending the throne when it is their turn because they remain High Chiefs despite their elevation. Makinde had, during his condolence visit to the family of the late Olubadan, said the ascendancy to the throne of Olubadan had never witnessed controversy because of the laid down traditions on succession where the next in line as Olubadan was usually known. He said the elevation of some High Chiefs to Oba by his predecessor in office caused the present controversy being witnessed. Meanwhile, a former governorship aspirant in the state on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, has commended Makinde for his position on the controversy over the appointment of a new Olubadan.

Shonekan, who died in Lagos on Tuesday at the age of 85, held the title of Abese of Egbaland. The family, led by the first son of the deceased, Adeboye, met with the monarch as tradition demands and told him of the passing away of the family head.

Adeboye was accompanied by some traditional chiefs from his father’s Itoko clan in the Abeokuta South Local Government of the state to inform the Alake-in-council of the former ING leader’s demise. Adeboye said the family had begun consultations with relevant authorities on the burial arrangements and dates. He said, “My father passed away early yesterday (Tuesday); we are now going to go for consultation and we will carry his royal highness (Alake) along; once the picture is clear, we shall make further announcements.          “He (Shonekan) was my mentor; he was a man of integrity; he was a decent man and he exemplified everything they call a thorough Christian; all I can do is just to aspire to be like him. “I will miss him for all those things I said; he was my mentor, someone I look up to everyday; he just led by example; everything I do, I used to consult him but he is not there anymore.” In his remarks, Oba Gbadebo recalled how he used to play squash with the deceased in 1984 and 1985 in Abeokuta. He described Shonekan as a proud son of Egbaland, who brought peace and unity to Nigeria during his short stint in government.

O. Shonekan for Egba; another Egba son will do better in the mighty name of Jesus; we pray that you (Adeboye) will surpass his achievements. Once again please accept our condolences. “I remember those days I used to play squash with him; I used to beat him and he used to beat me too; he had a squash court in his house and so it was convenient to play with him; that was in the year 1984- 1985.”           Meanwhile, Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has described Shonekan, as a seasoned administrator who did his best for the country. Sanwo-Olu said this on Wednesday in a condolence message issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile. He said, “On behalf of the Government and people of Lagos State, I want to express my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and associates of Chief Ernest Shonekan. “He was a renowned technocrat, seasoned administrator and passionate leader who served his country meritoriously as a public servant during his short tenure as number one citizen in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

Okowa, in a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Chief Patrick Ukah, on Wednesday said he received the news of the collapse “with shock and sadness.” According to the statement, the government has also suspended the processing and/or approval of building plans for the Core Area II until the panel of inquiry concludes its work.

Aghagba, Director, Ministry of Works; Rex Orhe, Deputy Director, Ministry of Works; Orerhime Iduseri, Ministry of Housing; Isichei Ekene, Ministry of Housing; and Moses Agwere, Assistant Director, Ministry of Justice, as members.  The Assistant Director, Office of the Secretary to the State Government, Igho Eduvie, will serve as secretary to the panel, which has two weeks to submit its report. The panel has among its terms of reference to inquire into and report on events surrounding the collapse of the building, including the number and identity of the deceased and the injured; the immediate and remote causes of the collapse; the scope and adequacy of current legislation, regulations, policies and processes concerning the safety of buildings for public use, and whether such legislation, regulations, policies and processes were complied with in the case of the affected building; and identify any person or institution culpable in that regard; as well as the scope and adequacy of current legislation, regulations, policies and processes concerning emergency management response to the collapse of the building. The panel is to also make recommendations on measures necessary or desirable to prevent or minimise the collapse of buildings in the state.          The state police command had earlier in a statement by the spokesman, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the death of three persons, two female children and a woman, in the tragedy. The police statement read in part, “Rescue operation is over; 18 persons were rescued initially; four persons were discharged and 11 persons are still receiving treatment; three deaths were recorded – two female children and one woman – their names unknown for now.

It was learnt that following the ownership transfer, the occupants of the building were asked to leave as the new owner embarked on renovation of the structure. However, the Salvation Ministry could not move as it had over two years’ rent paid to the former owner, but the new owner reportedly continued with the renovation work.           Our correspondent gathered that the contractor in charge of the renovation was busy supervising workers and over 150 worshippers were waiting to take Holy Communion when the building collapsed.

Zamfara communities panic over bandits’ one week ultimatum for N35m levy,https://punchng.com/zamfara-communities-panic-over-bandits-one-week-ultimatum-for-n35m-levy/,   Stephen Angbulu and Maiharaji Altine  Published 13 January 2022  Residents of five villages in the Gusau Local Government Area of Zamfara State are currently living in fear as bandits have written to them to demand N7m from each of them within a week. The affected villages are Banfara-Babba, Gidan Doraiyi, Banfara-Karama, Zamfarawa and Unguwar-Tofa. An indigene of Unguwar-Tofa, Mallam Sani Mohammed, told our correspondent on the telephone that the bandits sent letters to the respective leaders of the affected communities last Wednesday. Mohammed said the bandits gave a one-week ultimatum for the money to be paid or they would destroy the villages.  He stated, “They wrote the letters in Hausa language and directed each of the villages to hasten the collection of N7m from members of the communities and forward the amount to them within a week. “We have already started collecting the money from members of the communities and we hope to meet up with their demand before the expiration of the ultimatum, because we know that they will come and attack us if we fail to produce the money.” Mohammed lamented that due to the absence of security personnel in the area, the bandits had been subjecting the villagers to a nightmarish experience.          He added that even if the money was paid now, the bandits would still return to demand more. “They will still come back one day to look for more money if they exhaust the ones we are going to give them now,” he stated. When asked if the villagers had informed security agencies about their predicament, Mohammed said, “We complained to them times without number, but nothing has been done for us yet.” He noted that many residents had fled to other areas as “the bandits will not allow people to go way.” Read Also Zamfara rural communities at mercy of brutal terror attacks, demand more troopsHow Zamfara terrorists invaded our villages, killed over 200, burnt houses –SurvivorsBandits raid Zamfara community, kill head for resisting kidnap, abduct scores, burn vehicles  When contacted, the spokesman of the state police command, SP Mohammed Shehu, said, “We have already deployed additional security personnel in the affected villages. “A combined team of the police and other sister security agencies have been drafted to ensure total peace in the affected villages. “We are calling on the people of the state to continue giving security personnel necessary information that will lead to the success of the fight against banditry.”           Meanwhile, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday, condoled with the people of Zamfara State on what he called the “extremely unfortunate” mass killing of innocent people by retreating bandits. This is according to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled, ‘President Buhari’s delegation in Gusau, offers condolences on the extremely unfortunate Zamfara mass killings’. The delegation led by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.), described the recent incident as “a very sad one for the nation.” Buhari reiterated his commitment to tackling the monster of terrorism head-on, assuring those affected that the besieged communities and other Nigerians would not be abandoned to their fate. In his message to the state governor, commissioners, Emirs, the Chief Judge and Grand Khadi, legislators, council chairmen and political leaders, the President expressed the determination of his regime to get rid of the bandits, who had been classified as terrorists.

 Mali condemns 'clear breach' of airspace by French military plane,https://punchng.com/mali-condemns-clear-breach-of-airspace-by-french-military-plane/,   Agency Report  Published 12 January 2022  Mali’s army-dominated government on Wednesday condemned what it called a “clear breach” of its airspace by a French military aircraft this week, warning of potential consequences should such practices continue. Malian government spokesman Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga stated that a complaint had been issued to France after one of its military planes travelled between Ivory Coast’s capital Abidjan and the northern Malian city of Gao on Tuesday. The flight was a “clear breach” of Malian airspace, the statement said, given the closure of most of the country’s land and air borders due to regional sanctions recently imposed on the Sahel state. The French military plane had also switched off its transponder, preventing it from communicating with Malian aviation authorities, according to the statement.  It added that the government would “refuse all responsibility for the risks to which the perpetrators of these practices may be exposed in the event of a further violation of our airspace”. On Sunday, the Economic Community of West African States agreed to shutter land and air borders with Mali and impose a trade embargo over delayed elections. The sanctions — which France has backed — came after Mali’s army-dominated government last month proposed staying in power for up to five years before restoring democracy.           Read Also AFCON: Panic as gunshots rock Cameroon city hosting Mali, Tunisia, othersFrance backs ECOWAS sanctions against MaliMali junta condemns 'illegal' ECOWAS sanctions  Mali’s junta, following a military takeover in August 2020, had previously promised to hold elections on February 27. In response to the regional sanctions, Mali also announced that it was closing its borders with ECOWAS members — with the exception of military-run Guinea, which is not applying the measures. On Tuesday, West African air-traffic agency ASECNA informed Mali that its airspace had been breached by a French military plane. However, French army spokesman Pascal Ianni said that “the closure of the borders does not concern military flights”. France has thousands of troops in Mali and neighbouring Sahel countries as part of an anti-jihadist force. However, its relations with Mali, a former colonial possession, have deteriorated sharply since the 2020 military takeover. AFP

 Zulum cautions Ndume on inciting comments against repentant terrorists,https://punchng.com/zulum-cautions-ndume-on-inciting-comments-against-repentant-terrorists/,   Wim Bitrus  Published 12 January 2022  Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has cautioned Senator Ali Ndume against making comments that will incite the populace against repentant Boko Haram insurgents who are being reintegrated into the society. The Governor, during a courtesy visit by the Senate committee on army to the government house in Maiduguri, said the Senator has been inciting in his comments which ideally shouldn’t be heard of from a patriotic Borno citizen of the Senator’s standing. “I only have one discrepancy with Senator Ali Ndume. I heard him criticising the repentant terrorists and I felt that this should not have come from someone from Borno. I called him to register my disappointment with his comments. We know where we were before now. Ndume cannot go to his hometown without security escort. “Ndume’s hometown, Hambagda has been deserted for the past seven years and no one is living there. 95 per cent of his people cannot go to their farms till this moment. But the situation is different since we started witnessing the surrender of the terrorists. Areas under cultivation have increased by seven hundred per cent and farmers have had bumper harvests this year.  “Whether we like it or not, we have to welcome these repentant Boko Haram insurgents. Although some of them may not be genuine, quite a number of them are genuine. Relative peace is gradually returning to the state as such we should encourage them to surrender not incite the locals against them. “Out of the over 20,000 that have surrendered, about 5,000 of them are fighters. So imagine the destructions these fighters would cause if they haven’t surrendered. Until now, two local government areas of Borno State -Abadam and Guzamala, are still under the firm control of Boko Haram.

Mohammadu Buhari (retd.). Speaking on the mega school premises in the Muna area of Jere Local Government Area of the state, the governor said it is beyond coincidence for a school that has no form of electrical connections to blow up in fire if not for human action as such his government will make concerted efforts to unearth the source of the fire. He said, “This school was commissioned by President Mohammadu Buhari barely six months ago. The government has spent a huge amount of money but unfortunately, it has been completely razed down. “Preliminary investigations show that there is some level of sabotage because I see no reason why a school like this which has not been connected to the national grid, no NEPA no generator, no nothing, you just see fire at the last floor of the building.”  According to the principal of the school, Saidu Umaru, 19 classrooms and three laboratories were razed down by the fire on Monday morning, the first day of the school resumption.

Arome, in a grief-stricken Facebook post, uploaded the photo of Ojinimi and wrote, “My older brother, Ojinimi Osayi just passed (on) under very heartbreaking circumstances brought on by the massive insecurity that’s got Nigeria on a chokehold. He was kidnapped, ransom was paid yet did not make it because of serious strain on his health. “We did our best. Now we must defer to the unquestionable will of God. The grief is much but the joy of the Lord is our strength. We judge God faithful in the midst of it all.  “Rest on in the bosom of the Lord, big brother, ‘Ojay’, as we fondly called you.

Many Nigerians are disappointed in the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who rode to power on the heels of combating the security challenges plaguing the country in 2015 but the situation seems to have been aggravated in the last six and half years. The PUNCH had earlier reported that no fewer than 3,125 innocent persons were killed and 2,703 abducted by bandits in northern Nigeria in 2021, according to figures obtained from the Nigeria Security Tracker, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations’ an American think tank as well as quarterly reports released by the Kaduna State Government from January to September.

 Students’ group protests  warns northern varsities against fee hike,https://punchng.com/students-group-protests-warns-northern-varsities-against-fee-hike/,   Friday Olokor  Published 12 January 2022  The students’ wing of the Coalition of Northern Groups on Wednesday protested against the increase in school fees and other levies across tertiary institutions in the North. While giving the government three weeks ultimatum to address the issue to avoid “speaking” to it in the language it understands, the body warned that except stringent measures were put in place to check the increase, the number of girls who would drop out of school would increase. The national coordinator of CNG (Students Wing), Jamilu Aliyu, who raised the issues during a press conference in Abuja said institutions such as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi in the North-East; Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in the North-West; all with over 100 per cent increase in school fees and Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai in Niger State in the North-Central with over 60 per cent increase was very worrisome. He said, “The CNG-SW is disturbed by reports from its State chapters of an attempt by the federal and state governments to commercialize education to make it the exclusive preserve of treasury looters at the expense of children of millions of less-privileged Nigerians.  “If the fee hike is not reviewed downward, it may force many students to drop out of school and increase social vices, as students may be compelled to survive by all means. We, therefore, urge the government at all levels to revert to the old fee to enable students from poor and marginalised families to access tertiary education and break the chain of poverty. “Finally, while we appeal to the students to be law abiding and not to the take law into their own hands in the quest to seek reversal of the fee increase, we equally pray that the government will listen to the cries of innocent Nigerian students within three weeks to avoid speaking in a language that the government understands best.  All state coordinators should be on alert for further directives from the national secretariat. “There are institutions such as ATBU Bauchi in the North-East, ABU Zaria in the North-West all with over 100 per cent increase and IBB University In the North-Central with over 60 per cent Increase. The CNG Students’ Wing, hereby condemns, in the strongest terms, the hike in tuition fees as an untimely, immoral, unconscionable, height of insensitivity and unacceptable attempt to deny the children of the poor access to affordable education, entrench class dichotomy and widen the gap between the rich and the poor.           Read Also Fee hike: CNG issues three-week ultimatum to northern varsities, demands reversalUNIZIK student commits suicide over alleged hike in school feesAkwa Ibom varsity students protest 75% hike in school fees  “We find it ridiculous and sad that stakeholders, particularly the lawmakers, cannot summon the courage to speak or stand with the people that sacrificed so much to see them in office at this trying time to demand an immediate reversal in the hike.” “When people who are elected into offices are indifferent or afraid to speak up for what is right and just, then the situation is hopeless. It’s unfortunate, that people in government today who are major beneficiaries of the magnanimity and foresight of past Nigerian leaders in the provision of quality, accessible readily available and affordable education are today the same people working to deprive other generations of the same privileges. “It’s currently predicted that more girls will drop out of school following the current economic hardship, unemployment, poverty and insecurity which is crippling most of the commercial activities, particularly in Northern Nigeria. It’s worrisome that this was coming at a time when promoting girls education was at the front burner of global discourse, especially in developing countries. “This singular act has not showcased government’s responsiveness towards promoting inclusive education. This is disheartening to all well-meaning Nigerians and we urge the government to reconsider and rescind its decision,” Aliyu added. Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

 Perish your dream to become Nigeria’s President  HURIWA tells Umahi,https://punchng.com/perish-your-dream-to-become-nigerias-president-huriwa-tells-umahi/,   Kayode Oyero  Published 12 January 2022  Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, on Wednesday, asked Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, to perish his dream of becoming Nigeria’s next President. According to the group, Umahi had in the last six years as governor repressed press freedom and arrested journalists for reporting factual but negative developments in Ebonyi. National Coordinator of HURIWA, Emmanuel Onwubiko, made this known in a statement titled, ‘HURIWA to Umahi: You lack the temperament to be Nigeria’s President’. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Umahi visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Tuesday in Aso Rock and informed him of his decision to run for President in 2023.  But reacting, HURIWA said Umahi has demonstrated a “dictatorial” disposition against the press and should “perish his dreams of becoming President of Nigeria or to resign as governor to enable his deputy complete his remaining one year in office”. HURIWA said Umahi recently banned two journalists (Chijioke Agwu of Sun Newspaper and Peter Okutu of Vanguard Newspaper) from the Government House. The group also said the governor ordered the arrest of the two reporters over their reports on the Lassa Fever outbreak in the state and the alleged military invasion of Umuogodoakpu-Ngbo community in the state.

 IPOB: Why your reps must observe next trial -Nnamdi Kanu writes US  UK,https://punchng.com/ipob-why-your-reps-must-observe-next-trial-nnamdi-kanu-writes-us-uk/,   Sodiq Oyeleke  Published 12 January 2022  Leader of the Indigenous People Of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has invited representatives from the United Kingdom, United States and United Nations to observe court proceedings during his next trial. This was contained in a letter written to the two countries and UN, copies of which were obtained by our correspondent on Wednesday. Lawyer Ifeanyi Ejiofor, who wrote the letters on behalf of the IPOB leader, said the presence of the representatives would ensure fair hearing. The PUNCH had reported that Nnamdi Kanu is facing a seven-count amended charge preferred against him by the Federal Government.  The trial is expected to continue at the Federal High Court, Abuja Division on January 18, 19, and 20. The letter titled, ‘Request for delegate(s)/representative(s) to observe court proceedings …In Re: Charge NO. FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015, Federal Republic Of Nigeria V. Nnamdi Kanu’, read: “We write this letter on behalf of our client and with his consent and authority. In view of the foregoing, may we, gratefully, please, request you to send representative(s) to observe the proceedings of the court on those adjourned dates and on any other date to which further proceedings in the cause may be adjourned until the matter is disposed of.          “The need to ensure that our client is given a fair trial has compelled us to make this request. The instant request is compelling in the circumstance, to ensure that the whole process of our Client’s trial is fair and just in all circumstances. It must be remembered that his purported indictment on criminal charges has a political undercurrent. “This fact impels all truly democratic institutions of the world, to keep a close, watchful and attentive eye on the whole judicial process that has intervened to determine his culpability. The Nigerian Government, clearly, has a profound interest in the criminal charge pending against our client and the outcome of his trial.  Read Also France to ease UK travel restrictions on FridayUS sanctions five North Koreans after missile launchNnamdi Kanu writes, begs US to witness anti-terror trial  “The said Government overreached itself by ensuring that our client was brought back to Nigeria by every means possible. Some leading members of the Government have also made certain unsavoury comments about our client. For this reason, we view as compelling the need to invite representatives of true democratic institutions of the world to observe court proceedings in relation to his trial. “Further, we view the recent extra-judicial comment made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in a media chat he had with two journalists about the pending trial of our client with circumspection. We firmly believe that the comment approximates a taunt. To forestall any undesirable consequence that may eventuate on it, we consider it expedient that truly democratic institutions of the world send representatives to observe proceedings of the trial of our client. “We firmly believe that the presence of those representatives in court would make all parties tow the path of honour and rectitude and assure the fair trial of our client. In view of the foregoing, and anticipating your indulgence, may we then respectfully request you to forward to us the name of at least a representative, to enable us formally notify the court of his expected presence in court on the adjourned dates. “We also wish to use this opportunity to appeal to the United Nations to prevail on the Nigerian Government to caution her security agents. They should exhibit a modicum of civility in their operations and must refrain from harassing, intimidating, and or arresting innocent civilians who may throng the court premises on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January, 2022, in demonstration of their unwavering solidarity to our client.            “It is on record that these civilians who have remained devoted and steadfast in their commitment and solidarity have conducted themselves peacefully and in the most civil manner. It is also on record that, notwithstanding the fact that these civilians have always been peaceful in their conduct and show of solidarity, the security agents have continued to harass intimidate and arrest them. Many of these persons so arrested are still languishing in various detention facilities in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

 DSS keeping Kanu in 23-hour solitary confinement – IPOB,https://punchng.com/dss-keeping-kanu-in-23-hour-solitary-confinement-ipob/,   Ikenna Obianeri, Awka  Published 12 January 2022  The Indigenous People of Biafra has accused the Department of State Services of subjecting Nnamdi Kanu to 23-hour solitary confinement daily at its headquarters in Abuja. This is just as the group also alleged that the presiding judge in Kanu’s case, Justice Binta Nyako, was turning a blind eye to the impunity of the DSS against its leader. The group reminded both the judge and the DSS that solitary confinement of an innocent person is a crime as stipulated under Section 2 of the Anti-torture Act of 2017, which offence attracts 25 years imprisonment upon conviction. In a statement on Wednesday, its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said Justice Nyako had refused to ensure that DSS oblige and respect the fundamental rights of Kanu as provided in the rule of law.  Powerful also explained that a judge should be fair to all especially the accused who has not been convicted, adding that Kanu should not be treated with brutality simply because he is an Igbo. The statement read in parts, “Once again, we wish to raise the alarm over the continuous detention of our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, in solitary confinement at the State Security Services, headquarters Abuja. “We have seen that the presiding judge handling this case, Hon. Justice Binta Nyako is an accomplice to the suffering of an innocent man, who committed no crime known to law in Nigeria and the world. The judge has refused to ensure that the DSS oblige and respect the fundamental rights of Nnamdi Kanu as provided in the law.

If anything untoward happens to our leader in the DSS custody, they will regret his rendition from Kenya to Nigeria. Nnamdi Kanu is being held in solitary confinement for 23 hours every day where he is daily being subjected to mental and emotional torture because of his belief in Biafra freedom and independence. “The fact that all orders made by the court presided over by Justice Binta Nyako about the welfare and management of Kanu at the DSS dungeon were all flouted by the detaining authority, without being reprimanded or committed for contempt by the presiding judge. “We are calling on men and women of good conscience, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, intersociety and reputable Human Rights Organisations across the globe to prevail on Nigeria government and the compromised security agencies particularly the DSS, as well as justice Binta Nyako to release Nnamdi Kanu whose health condition needs urgent attention. “He should not be allowed to die in detention as such scenario will not be in the interest of anybody.” Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

 Recruitment: Police extend online registration by 10 days,https://punchng.com/recruitment-police-extend-online-registration-by-10-days/,   Segun Adewole  Published 12 January 2022  The Nigeria Police Force has extended the online registration in the ongoing 2021 recruitment exercise for interested and eligible Nigerians into the service of the Force as Police Constables. The new deadline for the registration on the portal is now Saturday, January 22, 2022. “With this extension, the NPF recruitment portal will remain open till midnight of the new date,” Police Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, said in a statement on Wednesday. He said, “The extension of the online application is informed by the need to ensure equal opportunity and even spread of applications, particularly from States in the South-East, South-South geopolitical zones and Lagos State, to enable them meet up with the required quota for their respective areas. A statistical analysis shows that a total of 81,005 applications were received nationwide as of January 7, 2022. Out of this figure, only 1,404 applications – less than 2 per cent of the total applications – were received from the five states in the South-East and 261 from Lagos State, with Anambra State having the least figure of 158 applicants.  “Consequently, the Force enjoins states and local governments, religious bodies and other interest groups in the affected Geopolitical zones and Lagos State to assist in mobilizing and encouraging their citizens and wards to take advantage of the opportunity to seek a career path in the Nigeria Police Force.

 Customs seizes 3 620 live ammunition cartridges in Kwara,https://punchng.com/customs-seizes-3620-live-ammunition-cartridges-in-kwara/,   Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin  Published 12 January 2022  The Nigeria Customs Service have seized 3,620 live ammunition cartridges in Kwara state, the Kwara Area Customs Commander, Comptroller Hussaini Ahmed, said on Wednesday. Displaying the ammunitions at the headquarters of the Command in Ilorin, Ahmed said they were seized in the new year at Bukuro in the Baruten Local Government Area of the state. Recall that the Joint Border Patrol Team Sector 3, North Central Zone of the Nigeria Customs Service covering Kwara, Kogi, Niger and Benue states intercepted 550 pump action gun cartridges in Adikpo junction, Benue State in December 2021. Ahmed said, “The Command is showcasing the strategic and remarkable seizures of a large quantity of ammunition packaged in 25 packs of 25 rounds each, contained in fourteen cartons, worth N1,444,000. This landmark seizure was made around the Bukuro axis of the Command.  “Based on an intelligence report, the Command intercepted a Peugeot 504 vehicle with registration number AP 448 AKD. On searching the vehicle, it was found to contain a large number of pump-action cartridges suspected to be smuggled into the country. Section 149 of the Customs and Excise Management Act of April 1958 Cap 45 LFN 2004 (as amended) gives Customs officers powers to search vehicles/ships. Ahmed who said that ammunition was classified under schedule 4 of Absolute Prohibition List of the Common External Tariff of the Nigeria Customs Service noted that “This epic seizure is very commendable at the backdrop of the heightened insecurity in the country. “Should 3,620 rounds of live ammunition of this magnitude find its way into the country and fall into the wrong hands, the result would be appalling, devastating and disastrous.”           Read Also Remembrance Day: AbdulRazaq salutes Armed Forces’ patriotismKwara school to represent Nigeria at youth football tourney in DenmarkFleeing driver conveying smuggled goods caused passenger’s death – Customs  Stressing the importance of the intelligence network in the country, the Controller said that greater successes are continuously being recorded by the Command. Despite resistance, threats and confrontations with charms, stones and other dangerous weapons by the perpetrators of this criminal act, officers were able to evacuate a total of 402 bags of foreign parboiled rice of 50kg each, using about 21 official patrol vehicles to convey the goods to the Command Headquarters. On revenue, the Controller disclosed that the Command generated a total sum of N19.159 billion between July 2019 and December 2021 which had been paid to the federation account. He said that out of the amount, the sum of N9.848 billion was generated between January and December 2021, which surpassed the revenue generated in the year 2020 with N2.942 billion.

 Oil ownership: Adebanjo backs Clark  says Obasanjo’s statement 'catalyst for Nigeria’s breakup',https://punchng.com/oil-ownership-adebanjo-backs-clark-says-obasanjos-statement-catalyst-for-nigerias-breakup/,   Kayode Oyero  Published 12 January 2022  Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, on Wednesday, criticised former President Olusegun Obasanjo, for saying that oil found in the Niger Delta region constitutionally belonged to Nigeria. Adebanjo, at a press briefing in Lekki, Lagos, expressed disappointment that 84-year-old Obasanjo cited Nigeria’s “flawed” constitution to make the “provocative statement” with “magisterial authority”. The 93-year-old Afenifere leader also unequivocally backed 94-year-old leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Ijaw National Congress, Chief Edwin Clark, that people oil produced in the Niger Delta states belonged to the people of the region and not to the people of Nigeria. Adebanjo’s speech was titled, ‘Obasanjo provocative statement, catalyst to Nigeria’s breakup: Niger Delta resources don’t belong to Nigeria’.  He went on a trip down memory lane and gave a perspective on constitutional evolution in Nigeria, insisting that the current 1999 Constitution must be changed to reflect fiscal federalism, regional autonomy and resource control. The nonagenarian said, “Before the issue degenerates therefore into disputation between two respectable elder statesmen (Obasanjo and Clark), I owe a duty to our founding fathers to throw some light on the historical constitutional evolution of the country to help us move Nigeria forward. “With my recent interaction with Gen. Obasanjo, I can appreciate his passion for a united Nigeria. But a united Nigeria does not exist from his own perspective and understanding only. Nigeria has existed before he became the President of the country with our founding fathers with equally great passion if not greater passion for a united Nigeria.          “Our colonial masters brought the various ethnic nationalities together through various constitutional reforms under a unitary form of government from 1914 to 1950 under Macpherson Constitution when Nigeria was divided into three regions namely Northern Region, Western Region and Eastern Region. “The Macpherson Constitution which was supposed to last five years under a unitary system collapsed in 1953 following a motion by the late Chief Anthony Enahoro for self-government for Nigeria in 1956. The then Colonial secretary Sir. Oliver Lyttleton later known as Lord Chandos summoned the political leaders, our founding fathers, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Chief Obafemi Awolowo to Lancaster House in London. Read Also 2023: Twitter ban lifted for political reasons, say NigeriansNigerians will vote APC despite falling naira, killings- Youth leaderBuhari arrives in Ogun, begins inauguration of projects  “It was at this conference that the defects in Macpherson Unitary Constitution were dissected and they settled for a Federal Constitution which became operative in 1954 with the establishment of the three autonomous regions headed by a Premier. “The provision of this Federal Constitution with some amendments was incorporated in the 1960 and 1963 Independence Constitution. The residual powers in the constitution reserved for the federating autonomous regions. Revenue allocation was agreed to be on derivation which you now refer to as resource control with the payment of 50% (section 140, 1963 Constitution) to the region where the revenue was derived. It was a two tier Federal system with the State government being co-ordinate and not subordinate to the Federal Government. “This was the peaceful co-existence position of the unity of the ethnic groups until 1966 when the military took over the government and abrogated the constitution agreed to by our founding fathers and set up the present 1999 constitution. The obnoxious provisions of this constitution have been the cause of instability in the country.” Continuing, Adebanjo added, “When General Obasanjo asserts that the Niger Delta Resources is not owned by Niger Delta but Nigeria, is the General suggesting that God created the resources in Niger Delta when Nigeria came into existence in 1914, or it was there before the amalgamation? “It is the amalgamation and the decision of our founding fathers to live together under the conditions agreed to in Independence Constitution that make other parts of Nigeria to lay claim to the resources of Niger Delta. The question of the protection of Niger Delta resources against external forces by the Federal government is not a big deal but a responsibility assigned to the Federal Government under the Federal System.           “I will therefore passionately appeal to General Obasanjo to join hands with the other patriots to bring pressure to bear on President Muhammad Buhari to ensure the change of the present fraudulent constitution by restructuring the present unitary constitution to the federal system agreed to by our founding fathers before the 2023 elections to enable the nation to move forward peacefully in unity and progress.” Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

 Loan shark declares defaulters dead  distributes obituaries to relatives  friends,https://punchng.com/loan-shark-declares-defaulters-dead-distributes-obituaries-to-relatives-friends/,   Oluwakemi Abimbola  Published 12 January 2022  A micro loan company has been accused of declaring defaulters dead, designing and circulating the obituaries of such persons to family and friends. A customer, Azuwuike Chinedu Achiever recently shared his experience with the loan company on social media. He said he had defaulted in his repayment plan for five days and the next thing he saw was his obituary. On a public group on Facebook, another customer of a loan app, Victoria Eyo Ekpo revealed she was also a victim and vowed not to repay the loan.  She said, “This is what Deloan (app) sent to me oooo. I will never pay. They called my mum and insulted her. May God help us.” (sic). Ekpo added that she borrowed the sum of N15,000. There have been concerns in the past about the activities of these loan sharks and the lack of regulation of their activities.          When PUNCH Online spoke with one of the contact persons of Deloans, who the Truecaller app identified as ‘Scammer,’ he denied ever doing that. The contact person, who simply identified himself as Somto “How can I do something like that? Am I not a human being?” Read Also Lenders give tips on how to avoid loan sharksLoan sharks devise underhand tactics, inflict pains on cash-strapped Nigerian borrowersLASCOPA seeks support on consumers’ sensitisation  Pressed further, he said he doesn’t have the authority to speak on the matter and that our reporter would need to speak to his bosses before abruptly ending the call. Further calls to his line went unanswered. Meanwhile, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Babatunde Irukera, has said that the regulators in the financial system are collaborating to address what is fast becoming a dominant and abusive practice targeting some of the most vulnerable in the society. Irukera said, “In November (2021), the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission hosted a meeting attended by the chief executive officer of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, and representatives of the National Information Technology Development Agency and the Central Bank of Nigeria; in leading an effort to address multiple potentially dubious conduct of certain money lenders, otherwise known as loan sharks. “Continuing complaints about questionable repayment enforcement practices including public shaming and violations of privacy, arbitrary, unjust, unreasonable, or exploitative interest rates and or loan balances calculations, harassment, and failure of consumer feedback mechanisms among others have led to significant and understandable consumer aggravation and dissatisfaction.”           Copyright PUNCH.All rights reserved.

 Fauci calls Republican Senator ‘moron’ after tense exchange,https://punchng.com/fauci-calls-republican-senator-moron-after-tense-exchange/,   Agency Report  Published 12 January 2022  Dr Anthony Fauci called Kansas Senator Roger Marshall a “moron” on Tuesday after a tense exchange over Fauci’s financial disclosures, a sign of the increasing hostility between conservatives and one of the nation’s top COVID-19 experts. Toward the end of a more-than-three-hour Senate Health Committee meeting, Marshall pointed to Fauci’s government salary of more than 400,000 dollars and asked whether he would make his financial disclosure available to the public. Fauci is a government employee and his financial disclosure forms are available to the public and can be accessed through a Freedom of Information Act request. “Wouldn’t you agree with me that you see things before members of Congress would see them, so that there’s an air of appearance that maybe some shenanigans are going on?  “I assume that’s not the case,” Marshall said. When Fauci called Marshall “misinformed” and said his financial disclosure was public information and available upon request, Marshall said his office had been unable to find the information. As Kansas Senator Jerry Moran prepared to ask a question, Fauci was caught on the microphone saying “what a moron” and “Jesus Christ.”          In a press release after the hearing, Marshall doubled down and said Fauci was “clearly distraught by the line of questioning.” “Calling me a moron during a Senate hearing may have alleviated the stress of the least trusted bureaucrat in America, but it didn’t take away from the facts,” Marshall said. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which was headed by Fauci, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Fauci was testifying with Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centres for Disease Control, and Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He said about the current surge of COVID-19 cases spreading through the country as a result of the Omicron variant. Throughout the pandemic, Fauci has been a target of conservatives who have chafed at the way the government has handled health restrictions. But nearly two years into the pandemic, tension has ratcheted up between Fauci and conservatives in Congress, where there was a partisan divide over who wore masks in the hallways and in the chamber.           Read Also US President's medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, to speak at Nigeria COVID-19 SummitRepublican senator to object certification of Biden winTop US scientist Fauci receives COVID-19 vaccine  Senator Rand Paul, who has been a frequent critic, has called Fauci “a lead architect” of the government’s response to the virus, from shutting down businesses at the beginning of the pandemic to urging people to wear a mask and get vaccinated. Earlier in the committee hearing, Marshall, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, questioned Fauci about his role in authorising “gain of function” research, a type of experiment where scientists change a virus to make it more potent as a way to study its effects. Marshall has said he would like a ban on a gain of function research and has made investigating the origins of COVID-19 a core platform for his first year in office. Fauci also clashed with Paul over an email exchange between him and former director of the National Institutes of Health Francis Collins. In which Collins and Fauci discussed how to combat what they called a “fringe” narrative about the pandemic raised by epidemiologists at prestigious universities. In response, Fauci held up a print-out of Paul’s Senate campaign website, where there was a picture of Fauci next to the text “Fire Dr Fauci” and several buttons where people can make donations to the campaign. Fauci talked about how he has gotten death threats after similar exchanges with Paul and said a man who was arrested driving from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. with an AR-15 and ammunition said he was going there to kill Fauci.          “He’s doing this for political reasons,” Fauci said. Fauci has often drawn the ire of activists. In the 1980s, he was among those criticised for the government’s slow response to the AIDS epidemic. Members of ACT UP burned him in effigy outside of the NIH building during one protest. But Fauci, who later became friends with some ACT UP leaders, has drawn a distinction between activists fighting for more resources for people with the disease. But also those who have criticised him for public health measures intended to decrease the spread of the virus. (dpa/NAN)

 Boris Johnson faces parliament over latest party scandal,https://punchng.com/boris-johnson-faces-parliament-over-latest-party-scandal/,   Agency Report  Published 12 January 2022  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a parliamentary reckoning Wednesday about another alleged breach of coronavirus rules that has prompted damning headlines and calls for him to quit. Johnson is under fierce pressure to say whether he attended a boozy gathering in the garden of his Downing Street residence in May 2020, in the midst of the country’s first strict lockdown. It follows a flurry of accusations about Downing Street parties held during lockdowns in 2020, which have dogged Johnson since late last year, sparking widespread public anger, sinking poll ratings and predictions he may have to resign — even from his own MPs. “If the prime minister knowingly attended a party I don’t see how he can survive, having accepted resignations for far less,” Conservative lawmaker Nigel Mills told the BBC.

The 57-year-old has stonewalled the issue since an email was leaked late Monday in which a senior official invited more than 100 colleagues to the event on May 20, 2020, encouraging them to “bring your own booze”. Johnson and his wife Carrie attended the gathering, according to anonymous witnesses quoted in the media, intensifying public anger from a time when millions were obediently respecting the lockdown rules.
