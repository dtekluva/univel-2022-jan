The  Lagos State Government has urged traders and business owners in the state to keep observing laid down safety guidelines to curb COVID-19.
The Special Adviser to the Governor on Central Business Districts, Mr Gbenga Oyerinde, made this call in a statement on Wednesday.
He said, “We noted that as the New Year begins for business, there is a need to continually enlighten traders and visitors on safety issues, traffic and environmental laws infringement.
“Most traders are beginning to lose consciousness of the need to observe health guidelines instituted to curb the spread of COVID-19. 
“We have re-strategised, refocused and have printed enlightenment materials to educate visitors and traders within the Lagos Island and Ikeja CBD axis to ensure that everyone coming to the business districts for either business or visiting are sensitised to the need to keep the business district safe and clean at all times.”
Oyerinde added that the enforcement team would ensure the safety of business owners. Read Also WHO warns against use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatmentTraders protest against Oyingbo market closureTimber traders beg Akeredolu to reopen Ondo forest reserves 
“The CBD enforcement unit and other government agencies are ready to ensure that safety, traffic, environmental and other security challenges associated with the high influx of shoppers and traders into the island are well managed.









“We, therefore, implore street traders using the walkways and kerbs to display their goods as well as motorists parking on bridges to desist from the illegal practice as the state will continue to impound vehicles and goods parked or displayed on walkways and kerbs,” he said.
