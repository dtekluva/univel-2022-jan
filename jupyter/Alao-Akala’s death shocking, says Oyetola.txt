Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has described the death of former governor of Oyo State, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, as a rude shock.
Oyetola, in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Ismail Omipidan, said he was pained by the sudden demise of the former Oyo political leader and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress.
Similarly, Oyetola also commiserated with his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, over the demise of his predecessor,
He also condoled Akala’s family, his political associates, government and people of Oyo State over the unfortunate incident. 
He described Akala’s death as a personal loss because the deceased was “a good friend of Osun who was always ready to identify with our government and celebrate our humble accomplishments and achievements.”
Oyetola recalled the laudable role Akala played during the resolution of the age-long battle between Oyo and Osun over the joint ownership of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, and gracing the State’s 30th anniversary Banquet and Awards which held last year.
