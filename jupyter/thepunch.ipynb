This is as some of the students took to popular micro-blogging platform, Twitter, to lament the increment which was described as both ”unfair” and  ”unjust” in protest.\n",
      "According to a student who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, some of them had been struggling to gather money for payment of the former fees due to the economic situation in the country but were shocked to learn of the new hike in fees.\n",
      "“Some of us are still struggling to make sure that our fees are complete and then we heard of the increment. There is economic hardship in this country. Where do they expect us to get the money to pay? Some of the people who spoke to the Vice Chancellor said the school explained that they needed money to construct some buildings; who will use the buildings if we cannot pay our school fees?”\n",
      "Another student also lamented the constant increment in fees which she claimed was also experienced in 2020.\n",
      "“The fees were increased in 2020. The funny thing is that new students have two weeks to pay. This is a federal university and not a private school, why is the school always increasing its fees?\n",
      "A student who also lamented his plight on Twitter via @akashi68 said, “Third time in a row, University of Abuja has and continues to increase school fees, adding 10k to every session, I paid 27k later paid 37k, now it is 47k”.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the spokesperson for the university, Dr. Habib Yakoob, when contacted by our correspondent, explained that the increment was a slight one. He explained that the university could no longer depend on the government for funds.\n",
      "He said, “The increment is not that significant; it was a slight increment but you see, no matter what anybody says, there would not be enough justification for why it is increased because even one kobo might not be affordable for our students. So, we sympathise with them but do remember that even some of our lecturers and other members of staff also have their children here, So, everybody is involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The University of Abuja is driving towards being a world-class university; a lot of developments have been taking place. We cannot also rely on the government for funds for the good things that the vice chancellor, the university management will want to carry out. So many projects and development are going on. So, with all of these, it requires some money and everybody is being taxed, not only the students. And it is just a slight review. There were consultations, it is not that the vice chancellor just woke up and decided to increase the fees,” he said.\n",

      "“Whether we like it or not, we have to welcome these repentant Boko Haram insurgents although some of them may not be genuine, but quite a number of them are genuine.

      "While giving the government three weeks ultimatum to address the issue, the organisation warned that except stringent measures are put in place to check the increase, the number of girls that would drop out of school would increase.\n",
      "The national coordinator of CNG (Students Wing), Jamilu Aliyu, raised the issues during a press conference in Abuja.\n",
      "Aliyu said institutions such as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi in the North East; Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in the North West made over 100 per cent increase and Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai in Niger State in the North Central made over 60 per cent increase. \n",
      "He said, “The CNG-SW is disturbed by reports from its state chapters of an attempt by the federal and state governments to commercialise education to make it the exclusive preserve of treasury looters at the expense of children of millions of less-privileged Nigerians.\n",
      "“If the fees hike is not reviewed downward, it might force many students to drop out of school and increase social vices, as students might be compelled to survive by all means.

      "Published 13 January 2022\n",
      "\n",
      "The intention of the Independent National Electoral Commission to register 20 million Nigerians before July, 2022 may have hit a brick wall as only 2.4 million Nigerians have completed their registration since the continuous voter registration  began in June 2021. This represents 12 per cent of INEC’s projection.\n",
      "The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had said last year that the commission was expecting to register 20 million Nigerians before July this year. The intended target was mostly youths who had crossed the age of 18 since the 2019 elections.\n",
      "However, latest statistics released by INEC on Monday showed that a total of 2, 429, 242 had completed their registration. However, the number of Nigerians that had filled online registration forms stood at 4.8 million, meaning that an extra 2.4 million Nigerians had completed their registration forms online but had not come forward to complete the physical one at an INEC office.\n",
      "It was also learnt that INEC had only printed about 40,000 permanent voter cards in Abuja because of the upcoming area council election. The rest of the country will be expected to receive their PVCs by the end of the year. \n",
      "A top INEC official, who wished to remain anonymous, because he was not authorised to speak to the press, said, “It is true that we targeted 20 million Nigerians for the registration exercise based on statistics and projections we received from the National Population Commission and other agencies on the expected population growth on those who have crossed the age of 18 since the 2019 elections.\n",
      "“We even simplified the process by ensuring that people can do half of the registration online and then complete the rest at INEC offices. However, it seems we may be witnessed voter apathy in 2023 going by the current statistics. Many people register online but refuse to come for the physical one.\n",
      "“The law does not make it compulsory for people to vote or to register. So, all we can do is to appeal to people to get involved. People should not wait till the last minutes to start struggling to register as they did in 2018.”\n",

      "When asked why INEC was stopping the registration exercise in July 2022 when the elections are holding in February 2023, the official said INEC was doing so in order to clean up the register.\n",
      "“Cleaning up the voter register entails removing the names of dead people, clearing double registrations, underage persons and aliens from the system. We will also need to pause so we can print the needed number of PVCs. These things take time so we will need to suspend the registration early enough,” the official said.\n",
      "While speaking ahead of the commencement of the voter registration exercise last June, INEC Chairman, Prof, Mahmoud Yakubu, had said the commission hoped to beat the registration record of the last elections.\n",
      "“Our hope is that unlike the 14.2 million we registered in the previous exercise, we are targeting a minimum of 20 million registrants this time. It will take the number of registered voters to about 100 million,” Yakubu said.\n",
      "The PUNCH had reported that the country’s voter register was grossly inaccurate as several dead persons including dead ex-governors remained on the register. INEC had said it did not have the statistics of deaths in order to clean up the voter register, adding that it was relying on Nigerians to assist in cleaning up the register.\n",
      "The country had in the 2019 elections witnessed its low voter turnout ever which may also have been based on the inaccuracy of the voter register which put the number of registered voters at 84 million. The voter turnout in which the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), won re-election, witnessed a turnout of 34.75 per cent.

There has been lots of dilly dallying.  If the President had probably signed the bill five months ago, the confidence of Nigerians would have been boosted but then people do not have the confidence.\n",
      "“Individuals do not have confidence that the elections will be free and fair. We are in a country where most people want to travel abroad, there are communities ravaged with crises, there are communities you cannot travel to as a result of insecurity.\n",
      "“I do not know the miracle which INEC wants to perform. Yes, the CSOs will have to do a lot of work but if INEC extends the registration, there is no guarantee that people will even register”.\n",
      "Also, The Executive Director, Centre for Transparency Advocacy, Nwadishi Faith, in a separate interview with one of our correspondents, said there was a need for more sensitisation.\n",
      "She added that politicians should be more involved, adding that they are the largest beneficiary of the exercise.\n",
      "She said,’’ If INEC says they are going to register 20 million Nigerians and they are not coming out to register there is nothing INEC can do. Sensitisation is the key here and it does not rest on the shoulders of INEC alone.  The Civil Society Oragnisations and political class especially have a role to play. They should ensure that people are mobilised to register.”\n",
      "Also speaking with The PUNCH, Princess Hamman-Obels, the Director of Electoral Hub, urged Nigerians to come out and register, saying that strength of a representative democracy lies in the level of citizen participation and inclusion in the electoral process.\n",

      "According to him, the invitation became necessary because of the need to ensure that he is given a fair trial after the recent interview granted by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to Channels TV, which was not comfortable to him and IPOB.\n",
      "Kanu’s lead counsel, Chief Ifeanyi Ejiofor, made the request in a letter to the American Ambassador to Nigeria dated January 11, 2022 and titled, ‘Request for delegate(s)/representative(s) to observe court proceedings in Re: Charge No. FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015, Federal Republic of Nigeria Vs. Nnamdi Kanu’, obtained by journalists in Abuja on Wednesday.\n",
      "Ejiofor said, “We write this letter to His Excellency on behalf of our client and with his consent and authority. May we respectfully notify His Excellency that criminal proceedings in respect of the amended seven counts preferred against our client and pending at the Federal High Court, Abuja Division, are due to continue on the January 18, 19 and 20, 2022. \n",

      "“The need to ensure that our client is given a fair trial has compelled us to make this request. The instant request is compelling in the circumstance to ensure that the whole process of our client’s trial is fair and just in all circumstances. It must be remembered that his purported indictment on criminal charges has a political undercurrent. This fact impels all truly democratic countries of the world to keep a close, watchful and attentive eye on the whole judicial process that has intervened to determine his culpability.\n",
      "“The Nigerian government, clearly, has a profound interest in the criminal charge pending against our client and the outcome of his trial. The said government overreached itself by ensuring that our client was brought back to Nigeria by every means possible. Some leading members of the government have also made certain unsavoury comments about our client.

We firmly believe that the comment approximates to a taunt. To forestall any undesirable consequence that may eventuate on it, we consider it expedient that truly democratic sovereign nations of the world send representatives to observe proceedings of the trial of our client.\n",
      "“We firmly believe that the presence of those representatives in court will make all parties to tow the path of honour and rectitude, and assure the fair trial of our client. In view of the foregoing, and anticipating the indulgence of His Excellency, may we then respectfully request His Excellency to forward to us the name of at least a representative to enable us formally notify the court of his expected presence in court on the adjourned dates.” Read Also IPOB: Why your reps must observe next trial -Nnamdi Kanu writes US, UKDSS keeping Kanu in 23-hour solitary confinement – IPOBIPOB: Court delivers judgment in Nnamdi Kanu's fundamental rights suit Jan 19 \n",

They should exhibit a modicum of civility in their operations and must refrain from harassing, intimidating and or arresting innocent civilians, who may throng the court premises on January 18, 19 and 20, 2022 in demonstration of their unwavering solidarity to our client.\n",
      "“It is on record that these civilians, who have remained devoted and steadfast in their commitment and solidarity, have conducted themselves peacefully and in the most civil manner. It is also on record that, notwithstanding the fact that these civilians have always been peaceful in their conduct and show of solidarity, the security agents have continued to harass, intimidate and arrest them.\n",
      "“Many of these persons so arrested are still languishing in various detention facilities in Nigeria. While thanking His Excellency for the expeditious attention accorded to this request, may His Excellency accept the assurance of our highest regards.”\n",
      "Although there has been no official disclosure about where and how Kanu was arrested by Interpol on June 27, 2021, the relatives and lawyers of the IPOB leader have described how he was taken into custody in Kenya under controversial circumstances and extradited to Nigeria, where he is currently facing trial for treasonable felony and terrorism before Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja over terrorism charges.\n",

      "According to a student who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, some of them had been struggling to gather money for payment of the former fees due to the economic situation in the country but were shocked to learn of the new hike in fees.\n",
      "“Some of us are still struggling to make sure that our fees are complete and then we heard of the increment. There is economic hardship in this country. Where do they expect us to get the money to pay? Some of the people who spoke to the Vice Chancellor said the school explained that they needed money to construct some buildings; who will use the buildings if we cannot pay our school fees?”\n",
      "Another student also lamented the constant increment in fees which she claimed was also experienced in 2020.\n",

      "But the spokesperson for the university, Dr. Habib Yakoob, when contacted by our correspondent, explained that the increment was a slight one. He explained that the university could no longer depend on the government for funds.\n",

So, we sympathise with them but do remember that even some of our lecturers and other members of staff also have their children here, So, everybody is involved.\n",

We cannot also rely on the government for funds for the good things that the vice chancellor, the university management will want to carry out. So many projects and development are going on. So, with all of these, it requires some money and everybody is being taxed, not only the students. And it is just a slight review. There were consultations, it is not that the vice chancellor just woke up and decided to increase the fees,” he said.\n",

      "Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has said there is an urgent need for the military and all security forces to work in synergy to crush the Islamic State’s West Africa Province terrorists.\n",
      "This is just as he said until now, two local governments are under Boko Haram.\n",
      "According to the governor, as Boko Haram insurgents continue to surrender in their thousands, the ISWAP terrorists become more sophisticated, deadly and continue to increase in number.\n",
      "He made this assertion on Wednesday at the Council Chambers of the Government House, while briefing members of the Senate Committee on the Army led by Ali Ndume. \n",
      "Zulum said ISWAP fighters were more sophisticated, educated, armed and brutal than Boko Haram terrorists and that as such, their operations were becoming more pronounced around the southern and extreme northern parts of Borno State.\n",
      "The governor stated, “It is an early warning for us as a government to understand the working system of ISWAP. We need to check them, chase them out while at their early stage, before they become stronger and a serious problem for us to handle.\n",
      "“They have been carrying out attacks in the southern and core northern part of Borno State. ISWAP has checkpoints between Damboa and Biu. They are collecting taxes from communities in these areas. Some few days ago, I got a very good intelligence that they held a wedding for over 300 fighters in the Mandara Mountains and they rode over 300 motorcycles. Something needs to be done.”\n",

      "He said despite the latest development, the situation was not as bad as it was some years back as peace was gradually returning to the state and villagers were engaging in farming activities thanks to the newfound working synergy among the stakeholders.\n",
      "“Somewhere along the line, we were able to understand the missing link. The missing link is synergy. There was no synergy between the government, the military, the police, the Civilian JTF and all other partners,” the governor added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Zulum has cautioned Ndume against making comments that will incite the populace against repentant Boko Haram insurgents, who are being reintegrated into the society. Read Also Zulum cautions Ndume on inciting comments against repentant terroristsZulum alleges sabotage as fire razes mega school inaugurated by BuhariZulum signs N269.9bn budget, Assembly hikes estimates by N1.7bn \n",
      "The governor said the senator had been inciting in his comments, which ideally should not be made by a patriotic citizen of Borno State.\n",
      "Zulum said, “I only have one discrepancy with Senator Ali Ndume. I heard him criticising the repentant terrorists and I felt that this should not have come from someone from Borno. I called him to register my disappointment with his comments. We know where we were before now. Ndume cannot go to his hometown without security escort.\n",
      "“Ndume’s hometown, Hambagda, has been deserted for the past seven years and no one is living there. Ninety-five per cent of his people cannot go to their farms till this moment. But the situation is different since we started witnessing the surrender of the terrorists. Areas under cultivation have increased by 700 per cent and farmers have had bumper harvest this year.\n",
      "“Whether we like it or not, we have to welcome these repentant Boko Haram insurgents although some of them may not be genuine, but quite a number of them are genuine. Relative peace is gradually returning to the state; as such, we should encourage them to surrender and not incite the locals against them.\n",

Until now, two local government areas of Borno State, Abadam and Guzamala, are still under the firm control of Boko Haram.\n",
      "“Some communities in eight local government areas, including Gwoza, Damboa, Bama and Chibok a still have elements of Boko Haram insurgents.”\n",
      "Zulum said the state government would continue to explore avenues to encourage the insurgents to surrender their arms for peace to return to the state under his administration.\n",

      "Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on Wednesday met All Progressives Congress leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, over the forthcoming APC governorship primary in Ekiti State and the 2023 Presidential poll.\n",
      "Fayemi’s visit to Tinubu came barely two days after Tinubu revealed his intention to contest the Presidency.\n",
      "Top sources told The PUNCH that Fayemi, who is also the Chairman, Nigerian Governors’ Forum, had discussions with Tinubu over the latter’s Presidential ambition and the need to ensure that the South-West gets the APC Presidential ticket.\n",
      "To this end, it was learnt that the South-West APC may be endorsing one candidate in order to present a united front. \n",
      "A politician who spoke to The PUNCH because he wasn’t authorised to speak with the press, said Fayemi and Tinubu’s relationship had become frosty in recent time due to Fayemi’s role in the sacking of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee and his hobnobbing with the APC Caretaker Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n",
      "He recalled that Fayemi, who is also believed to be nursing a Presidential ambition, had been accused of victimising Tinubu’s supporters under the aegis of the South West Agenda 2023 led by Senator Dayo Adeyeye and preventing them from holding processions in the state. Pro-Tinubu groups had also conducted a parallel congress in Ekiti State.

      "“Discussions on 2023 also took place with a view to presenting one South-West consensus. If the South-West is divided, the region could be denied the APC Presidential ticket. So, such consultations will continue.”\n",

      "He said, “The CNG-SW is disturbed by reports from its state chapters of an attempt by the federal and state governments to commercialise education to make it the exclusive preserve of treasury looters at the expense of children of millions of less-privileged Nigerians.\n",

      "The intention of the Independent National Electoral Commission to register 20 million Nigerians before July, 2022 may have hit a brick wall as only 2.4 million Nigerians have completed their registration since the continuous voter registration  began in June 2021. This represents 12 per cent of INEC’s projection.\n",
      "The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had said last year that the commission was expecting to register 20 million Nigerians before July this year. The intended target was mostly youths who had crossed the age of 18 since the 2019 elections.\n",
      "However, latest statistics released by INEC on Monday showed that a total of 2, 429, 242 had completed their registration. However, the number of Nigerians that had filled online registration forms stood at 4.8 million, meaning that an extra 2.4 million Nigerians had completed their registration forms online but had not come forward to complete the physical one at an INEC office.\n",
      "It was also learnt that INEC had only printed about 40,000 permanent voter cards in Abuja because of the upcoming area council election. The rest of the country will be expected to receive their PVCs by the end of the year. \n",
      "A top INEC official, who wished to remain anonymous, because he was not authorised to speak to the press, said, “It is true that we targeted 20 million Nigerians for the registration exercise based on statistics and projections we received from the National Population Commission and other agencies on the expected population growth on those who have crossed the age of 18 since the 2019 elections.\n",
      "“We even simplified the process by ensuring that people can do half of the registration online and then complete the rest at INEC offices. However, it seems we may be witnessed voter apathy in 2023 going by the current statistics. Many people register online but refuse to come for the physical one.\n",
      "“The law does not make it compulsory for people to vote or to register. So, all we can do is to appeal to people to get involved. People should not wait till the last minutes to start struggling to register as they did in 2018.”\n",

      "\n",
      "When asked why INEC was stopping the registration exercise in July 2022 when the elections are holding in February 2023, the official said INEC was doing so in order to clean up the register.\n",
      "“Cleaning up the voter register entails removing the names of dead people, clearing double registrations, underage persons and aliens from the system. We will also need to pause so we can print the needed number of PVCs. These things take time so we will need to suspend the registration early enough,” the official said.\n",
      "While speaking ahead of the commencement of the voter registration exercise last June, INEC Chairman, Prof, Mahmoud Yakubu, had said the commission hoped to beat the registration record of the last elections.\n",
      "“Our hope is that unlike the 14.2 million we registered in the previous exercise, we are targeting a minimum of 20 million registrants this time. It will take the number of registered voters to about 100 million,” Yakubu said.\n",
      "The PUNCH had reported that the country’s voter register was grossly inaccurate as several dead persons including dead ex-governors remained on the register. INEC had said it did not have the statistics of deaths in order to clean up the voter register, adding that it was relying on Nigerians to assist in cleaning up the register.\n",
      "The country had in the 2019 elections witnessed its low voter turnout ever which may also have been based on the inaccuracy of the voter register which put the number of registered voters at 84 million. The voter turnout in which the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), won re-election, witnessed a turnout of 34.75 per cent.

There has been lots of dilly dallying.  If the President had probably signed the bill five months ago, the confidence of Nigerians would have been boosted but then people do not have the confidence.\n",
      "“Individuals do not have confidence that the elections will be free and fair. We are in a country where most people want to travel abroad, there are communities ravaged with crises, there are communities you cannot travel to as a result of insecurity.\n",
      "“I do not know the miracle which INEC wants to perform. Yes, the CSOs will have to do a lot of work but if INEC extends the registration, there is no guarantee that people will even register”.\n",
      "Also, The Executive Director, Centre for Transparency Advocacy, Nwadishi Faith, in a separate interview with one of our correspondents, said there was a need for more sensitisation.\n",
      "She added that politicians should be more involved, adding that they are the largest beneficiary of the exercise.\n",
      "She said,’’ If INEC says they are going to register 20 million Nigerians and they are not coming out to register there is nothing INEC can do. Sensitisation is the key here and it does not rest on the shoulders of INEC alone.  The Civil Society Oragnisations and political class especially have a role to play. They should ensure that people are mobilised to register.”\n",

May we respectfully notify His Excellency that criminal proceedings in respect of the amended seven counts preferred against our client and pending at the Federal High Court, Abuja Division, are due to continue on the January 18, 19 and 20, 2022. \n",
      "“In view of the foregoing, may we gratefully request His Excellency to send representative(s) of the United States Embassy to observe the proceedings of the court on those adjourned dates and on any other date to which further proceedings in the cause may be adjourned until the matter is disposed of?\n",
      "“The need to ensure that our client is given a fair trial has compelled us to make this request. The instant request is compelling in the circumstance to ensure that the whole process of our client’s trial is fair and just in all circumstances. It must be remembered that his purported indictment on criminal charges has a political undercurrent. This fact impels all truly democratic countries of the world to keep a close, watchful and attentive eye on the whole judicial process that has intervened to determine his culpability.\n",
      "“The Nigerian government, clearly, has a profound interest in the criminal charge pending against our client and the outcome of his trial. The said government overreached itself by ensuring that our client was brought back to Nigeria by every means possible. Some leading members of the government have also made certain unsavoury comments about our client. For this reason, we view as compelling the need to invite representatives of true democratic nations of the world to observe court proceedings in relation to his trial.\n",

We firmly believe that the comment approximates to a taunt. To forestall any undesirable consequence that may eventuate on it, we consider it expedient that truly democratic sovereign nations of the world send representatives to observe proceedings of the trial of our client.\n",
      "“We firmly believe that the presence of those representatives in court will make all parties to tow the path of honour and rectitude, and assure the fair trial of our client. In view of the foregoing, and anticipating the indulgence of His Excellency, may we then respectfully request His Excellency to forward to us the name of at least a representative to enable us formally notify the court of his expected presence in court on the adjourned dates.” Read Also IPOB: Why your reps must observe next trial -Nnamdi Kanu writes US, UKDSS keeping Kanu in 23-hour solitary confinement – IPOBIPOB: Court delivers judgment in Nnamdi Kanu's fundamental rights suit Jan 19 \n",

They should exhibit a modicum of civility in their operations and must refrain from harassing, intimidating and or arresting innocent civilians, who may throng the court premises on January 18, 19 and 20, 2022 in demonstration of their unwavering solidarity to our client.\n",
      "“It is on record that these civilians, who have remained devoted and steadfast in their commitment and solidarity, have conducted themselves peacefully and in the most civil manner. It is also on record that, notwithstanding the fact that these civilians have always been peaceful in their conduct and show of solidarity, the security agents have continued to harass, intimidate and arrest them.\n",
      "“Many of these persons so arrested are still languishing in various detention facilities in Nigeria. While thanking His Excellency for the expeditious attention accorded to this request, may His Excellency accept the assurance of our highest regards.”\n",

      "He said, “The removal of the ban itself is not unexpected, because regardless of the Buhari regime’s posturing over the past seven months, it is in fact Twitter that always had the bargaining position. Nigeria needs Twitter and not the other way around. We have wasted seven months of our time as a nation pursuing an imaginary outcome against a global tech giant with a market cap bigger than Nigeria’s annual federal budget.\n",

      "Lawan made the lamentation at the Maitama Guest House of the Senate President in Abuja on Wednesday, where senators visited him on his 63rd birthday.\n",
      "He said, “Few days ago, reports have it that over 200 people were killed in Zamfara. This is not the kind of story we want to hear as a people and as a government. The situation is not too good as far as the wanton killings by all manners of criminals are concerned.\n",
      "“I, however, believe that things can be turned around for better within the remaining one and half years left for this present administration, inclusive of the 9th National Assembly.”\n",

      "“In supporting the security agencies for more potent war against the killers in the land, the National Assembly has appropriated over N1tn for security in the 2022 budget, which will be monitored very well for desired results. In achieving this, our relevant committees will ensure that procurement process is transparent and what and what was projected to be bought or acquired, are bought.\n",
      "“The security situation in the country is begging for more attention and it shall be given because that is the primary purpose of governance “, he added.\n",

Areas under cultivation have increased by seven hundred per cent and farmers have had bumper harvests this year. \n",

Relative peace is gradually returning to the state as such we should encourage them to surrender not incite the locals against them.\n",
      "“Out of the over 20,000 that have surrendered, about 5,000 of them are fighters. So imagine the destructions these fighters would cause if they haven’t surrendered.

      "Leader of the Indigenous People Of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has invited representatives from the United Kingdom, United States and United Nations to observe court proceedings during his next trial.\n",
      "This was contained in a letter written to the two countries and UN, copies of which were obtained by our correspondent on Wednesday.\n",
      "Lawyer Ifeanyi Ejiofor, who wrote the letters on behalf of the IPOB leader, said the presence of the representatives would ensure fair hearing.\n",
      "The PUNCH had reported that Nnamdi Kanu is facing a seven-count amended charge preferred against him by the Federal Government. \n",
      "The trial is expected to continue at the Federal High Court, Abuja Division on January 18, 19, and 20.\n",
      "The letter titled, ‘Request for delegate(s)/representative(s) to observe court proceedings …In Re: Charge NO. FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015, Federal Republic Of Nigeria V. Nnamdi Kanu’, read:\n",
      "“We write this letter on behalf of our client and with his consent and authority. In view of the foregoing, may we, gratefully, please, request you to send representative(s) to observe the proceedings of the court on those adjourned dates and on any other date to which further proceedings in the cause may be adjourned until the matter is disposed of.\n",

The instant request is compelling in the circumstance, to ensure that the whole process of our Client’s trial is fair and just in all circumstances. It must be remembered that his purported indictment on criminal charges has a political undercurrent.\n",
      "“This fact impels all truly democratic institutions of the world, to keep a close, watchful and attentive eye on the whole judicial process that has intervened to determine his culpability.

      "“The said Government overreached itself by ensuring that our client was brought back to Nigeria by every means possible. Some leading members of the Government have also made certain unsavoury comments about our client. For this reason, we view as compelling the need to invite representatives of true democratic institutions of the world to observe court proceedings in relation to his trial.\n",
      "“Further, we view the recent extra-judicial comment made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in a media chat he had with two journalists about the pending trial of our client with circumspection. We firmly believe that the comment approximates a taunt. To forestall any undesirable consequence that may eventuate on it, we consider it expedient that truly democratic institutions of the world send representatives to observe proceedings of the trial of our client.\n",
      "“We firmly believe that the presence of those representatives in court would make all parties tow the path of honour and rectitude and assure the fair trial of our client.\n",
      "In view of the foregoing, and anticipating your indulgence, may we then respectfully request you to forward to us the name of at least a representative, to enable us formally notify the court of his expected presence in court on the adjourned dates.\n",
      "“We also wish to use this opportunity to appeal to the United Nations to prevail on the Nigerian Government to caution her security agents. They should exhibit a modicum of civility in their operations and must refrain from harassing, intimidating, and or arresting innocent civilians who may throng the court premises on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January, 2022, in demonstration of their unwavering solidarity to our client. \n",

      "The Indigenous People of Biafra has accused the Department of State Services of subjecting Nnamdi Kanu to 23-hour solitary confinement daily at its headquarters in Abuja.\n",
      "This is just as the group also alleged that the presiding judge in Kanu’s case, Justice Binta Nyako, was turning a blind eye to the impunity of the DSS against its leader.\n",
      "The group reminded both the judge and the DSS that solitary confinement of an innocent person is a crime as stipulated under Section 2 of the Anti-torture Act of 2017, which offence attracts 25 years imprisonment upon conviction.\n",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said Justice Nyako had refused to ensure that DSS oblige and respect the fundamental rights of Kanu as provided in the rule of law. \n",
      "Powerful also explained that a judge should be fair to all especially the accused who has not been convicted, adding that Kanu should not be treated with brutality simply because he is an Igbo.\n",
      "The statement read in parts, “Once again, we wish to raise the alarm over the continuous detention of our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, in solitary confinement at the State Security Services, headquarters Abuja.\n",
      "“We have seen that the presiding judge handling this case, Hon. Justice Binta Nyako is an accomplice to the suffering of an innocent man, who committed no crime known to law in Nigeria and the world.

      "“The fact that all orders made by the court presided over by Justice Binta Nyako about the welfare and management of Kanu at the DSS dungeon were all flouted by the detaining authority, without being reprimanded or committed for contempt by the presiding judge.\n",
      "“We are calling on men and women of good conscience, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, intersociety and reputable Human Rights Organisations across the globe to prevail on Nigeria government and the compromised security agencies particularly the DSS, as well as justice Binta Nyako to release Nnamdi Kanu whose health condition needs urgent attention.\n",

      "“With this extension, the NPF recruitment portal will remain open till midnight of the new date,” Police Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n",
      "He said, “The extension of the online application is informed by the need to ensure equal opportunity and even spread of applications, particularly from States in the South-East, South-South geopolitical zones and Lagos State, to enable them meet up with the required quota for their respective areas. A statistical analysis shows that a total of 81,005 applications were received nationwide as of January 7, 2022. Out of this figure, only 1,404 applications – less than 2 per cent of the total applications – were received from the five states in the South-East and 261 from Lagos State, with Anambra State having the least figure of 158 applicants. \n",
      "“Consequently, the Force enjoins states and local governments, religious bodies and other interest groups in the affected Geopolitical zones and Lagos State to assist in mobilizing and encouraging their citizens and wards to take advantage of the opportunity to seek a career path in the Nigeria Police Force.

      "The Nigeria Customs Service have seized 3,620 live ammunition cartridges in Kwara state, the Kwara Area Customs Commander, Comptroller Hussaini Ahmed, said on Wednesday.\n",
      "Displaying the ammunitions at the headquarters of the Command in Ilorin, Ahmed said they were seized in the new year at Bukuro in the Baruten Local Government Area of the state.\n",
      "Recall that the Joint Border Patrol Team Sector 3, North Central Zone of the Nigeria Customs Service covering Kwara, Kogi, Niger and Benue states intercepted 550 pump action gun cartridges in Adikpo junction, Benue State in December 2021.\n",
      "Ahmed said, “The Command is showcasing the strategic and remarkable seizures of a large quantity of ammunition packaged in 25 packs of 25 rounds each, contained in fourteen cartons, worth N1,444,000. This landmark seizure was made around the Bukuro axis of the Command. \n",
      "“Based on an intelligence report, the Command intercepted a Peugeot 504 vehicle with registration number AP 448 AKD. On searching the vehicle, it was found to contain a large number of pump-action cartridges suspected to be smuggled into the country. Section 149 of the Customs and Excise Management Act of April 1958 Cap 45 LFN 2004 (as amended) gives Customs officers powers to search vehicles/ships.\n",
      "Ahmed who said that ammunition was classified under schedule 4 of Absolute Prohibition List of the Common External Tariff of the Nigeria Customs Service noted that “This epic seizure is very commendable at the backdrop of the heightened insecurity in the country.\n",
      "“Should 3,620 rounds of live ammunition of this magnitude find its way into the country and fall into the wrong hands, the result would be appalling, devastating and disastrous.”\n",

      "Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, on Wednesday, criticised former President Olusegun Obasanjo, for saying that oil found in the Niger Delta region constitutionally belonged to Nigeria.\n",
      "Adebanjo, at a press briefing in Lekki, Lagos, expressed disappointment that 84-year-old Obasanjo cited Nigeria’s “flawed” constitution to make the “provocative statement” with “magisterial authority”.\n",
      "The 93-year-old Afenifere leader also unequivocally backed 94-year-old leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Ijaw National Congress, Chief Edwin Clark, that people oil produced in the Niger Delta states belonged to the people of the region and not to the people of Nigeria.\n",
      "Adebanjo’s speech was titled, ‘Obasanjo provocative statement, catalyst to Nigeria’s breakup: Niger Delta resources don’t belong to Nigeria’. \n",
      "He went on a trip down memory lane and gave a perspective on constitutional evolution in Nigeria, insisting that the current 1999 Constitution must be changed to reflect fiscal federalism, regional autonomy and resource control.\n",
      "The nonagenarian said, “Before the issue degenerates therefore into disputation between two respectable elder statesmen (Obasanjo and Clark), I owe a duty to our founding fathers to throw some light on the historical constitutional evolution of the country to help us move Nigeria forward.\n",
      "“With my recent interaction with Gen. Obasanjo, I can appreciate his passion for a united Nigeria. But a united Nigeria does not exist from his own perspective and understanding only. Nigeria has existed before he became the President of the country with our founding fathers with equally great passion if not greater passion for a united Nigeria.\n",

      "“Our colonial masters brought the various ethnic nationalities together through various constitutional reforms under a unitary form of government from 1914 to 1950 under Macpherson Constitution when Nigeria was divided into three regions namely Northern Region, Western Region and Eastern Region.\n",
      "“The Macpherson Constitution which was supposed to last five years under a unitary system collapsed in 1953 following a motion by the late Chief Anthony Enahoro for self-government for Nigeria in 1956. The then Colonial secretary Sir. Oliver Lyttleton later known as Lord Chandos summoned the political leaders, our founding fathers, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Chief Obafemi Awolowo to Lancaster House in London.

      "“It was at this conference that the defects in Macpherson Unitary Constitution were dissected and they settled for a Federal Constitution which became operative in 1954 with the establishment of the three autonomous regions headed by a Premier.\n",
      "“The provision of this Federal Constitution with some amendments was incorporated in the 1960 and 1963 Independence Constitution. The residual powers in the constitution reserved for the federating autonomous regions. Revenue allocation was agreed to be on derivation which you now refer to as resource control with the payment of 50% (section 140, 1963 Constitution) to the region where the revenue was derived. It was a two tier Federal system with the State government being co-ordinate and not subordinate to the Federal Government.\n",
      "“This was the peaceful co-existence position of the unity of the ethnic groups until 1966 when the military took over the government and abrogated the constitution agreed to by our founding fathers and set up the present 1999 constitution. The obnoxious provisions of this constitution have been the cause of instability in the country.”\n",
      "Continuing, Adebanjo added, “When General Obasanjo asserts that the Niger Delta Resources is not owned by Niger Delta but Nigeria, is the General suggesting that God created the resources in Niger Delta when Nigeria came into existence in 1914, or it was there before the amalgamation?\n",
      "“It is the amalgamation and the decision of our founding fathers to live together under the conditions agreed to in Independence Constitution that make other parts of Nigeria to lay claim to the resources of Niger Delta. The question of the protection of Niger Delta resources against external forces by the Federal government is not a big deal but a responsibility assigned to the Federal Government under the Federal System.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr Anthony Fauci called Kansas Senator Roger Marshall a “moron” on Tuesday after a tense exchange over Fauci’s financial disclosures, a sign of the increasing hostility between conservatives and one of the nation’s top COVID-19 experts.\n",
      "Toward the end of a more-than-three-hour Senate Health Committee meeting, Marshall pointed to Fauci’s government salary of more than 400,000 dollars and asked whether he would make his financial disclosure available to the public.\n",
      "Fauci is a government employee and his financial disclosure forms are available to the public and can be accessed through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n",
      "“Wouldn’t you agree with me that you see things before members of Congress would see them, so that there’s an air of appearance that maybe some shenanigans are going on? \n",
      "“I assume that’s not the case,” Marshall said.\n",
      "When Fauci called Marshall “misinformed” and said his financial disclosure was public information and available upon request, Marshall said his office had been unable to find the information.\n",
      "As Kansas Senator Jerry Moran prepared to ask a question, Fauci was caught on the microphone saying “what a moron” and “Jesus Christ.”\n",

      "“Calling me a moron during a Senate hearing may have alleviated the stress of the least trusted bureaucrat in America, but it didn’t take away from the facts,” Marshall said.\n",
      "The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which was headed by Fauci, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "Fauci was testifying with Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centres for Disease Control, and Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "He said about the current surge of COVID-19 cases spreading through the country as a result of the Omicron variant.\n",

      "Earlier in the committee hearing, Marshall, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, questioned Fauci about his role in authorising “gain of function” research, a type of experiment where scientists change a virus to make it more potent as a way to study its effects.\n",
      "Marshall has said he would like a ban on a gain of function research and has made investigating the origins of COVID-19 a core platform for his first year in office.\n",
      "Fauci also clashed with Paul over an email exchange between him and former director of the National Institutes of Health Francis Collins.\n",
      "In which Collins and Fauci discussed how to combat what they called a “fringe” narrative about the pandemic raised by epidemiologists at prestigious universities.\n",
      "In response, Fauci held up a print-out of Paul’s Senate campaign website, where there was a picture of Fauci next to the text “Fire Dr Fauci” and several buttons where people can make donations to the campaign.\n",
      "Fauci talked about how he has gotten death threats after similar exchanges with Paul and said a man who was arrested driving from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. with an AR-15 and ammunition said he was going there to kill Fauci.\n",

      "A human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, says it is shameful for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and members of his regime to return to microblogging site, Twitter after suspending the social media platform for over seven months.\n",
      "The founder of the civic group, Concerned Nigerians, in a chat with The PUNCH on Thursday, described the Twitter ban as an anti-democratic and unconstitutional act in the first place.\n",
      "Also, activist David Hundeyin said Buhari has succeeded in massaging his ego for over seven months since he suspended the micro-blogging platform on June 4, 2021.\n",
      "He said, “The removal of the ban itself is not unexpected, because regardless of the Buhari regime’s posturing over the past seven months, it is in fact Twitter that always had the bargaining position. Nigeria needs Twitter and not the other way around. We have wasted seven months of our time as a nation pursuing an imaginary outcome against a global tech giant with a market cap bigger than Nigeria’s annual federal budget.” \n",
      "The Buhari regime had suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria on June 4, 2021, after the micro-blogging platform deleted a controversial civil war post by the President. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had said the “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence”.\n",
      "According to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool, Nigeria’s economy lost N104.02m ($250,600) every hour to the ban on Twitter as of December 2021.\n",
      "The regime, however, said it has lifted the suspension, effective January 13, 2022.\n",

Read Also Garba Shehu under fire over first post after Twitter returnsNigeria better with conditions met, Keyamo returns to TwitterTwitter reacts as operations resume in Nigeria after 222 days' suspension \n",
      "He said, “It is indeed shameful for President Buhari, Garba Shehu and others to return to Twitter after subverting the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the Twitter Ban and returning to the same platform they denied Nigerians from using for many months. The ban had no place in law and was a clear violation of section 39 rights of Nigerians.\n",
      "“The Twitter ban in the first place is an anti-democratic act, it is unconstitutional, has no basis in law because our constitution has made explicit provision that Nigerians have the right to express themselves and have the right to hold opinion and receive information. So, the ban was a contravention of the rights of Nigerians on social media, especially on Twitter.”\n",
      "The activist also said the ban and its lifting have already portrayed Nigeria in bad light among the comity of nations, adding that the development would affect the human rights index of the country.\n",
      "“There should not only be freedom of speech but freedom after speech,” he said.\n",
      "Nigeria has over 33 million active social media users. WhatsApp is the most popular platform used in the country, with over 90 million users according to Statista. About 61.4 per cent of Nigerian social media users use Twitter, 86.2 per cent use Facebook, 81.6 per cent use YouTube, 73.1 per cent use Instagram, and 67.2 per cent use Facebook Messenger.\n",

So, with all of these, it requires some money and everybody is being taxed, not only the students. And it is just a slight review.

      "He tweeted, “$750 million. In case you are wondering, that is exactly what Nigeria lost in 222 days of banning Twitter.\n",
      "“So, if anybody is telling you that Nigeria won with the #TwitterBan, ask them to tell you what exactly Nigeria won. Nigeria lost big time! \n",
      "“The claim that Twitter agreed to allow Buhari’s junta regulate Twitter users in Nigeria is as fakes as Buhari’s integrity.\n",
      "“The expectation that Twitter would move from Ghana to Nigeria will never happen. Twitter did not beg. Buhari bulged because elections are here!”\n",

      "A human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, says it is shameful for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and members of his regime to return to microblogging site, Twitter after suspending the social media platform for over seven months.\n",
      "The founder of the civic group, Concerned Nigerians, in a chat with The PUNCH on Thursday, described the Twitter ban as an anti-democratic and unconstitutional act in the first place.\n",
      "Also, activist David Hundeyin said Buhari has succeeded in massaging his ego for over seven months since he suspended the micro-blogging platform on June 4, 2021.\n",
      "He said, “The removal of the ban itself is not unexpected, because regardless of the Buhari regime’s posturing over the past seven months, it is in fact Twitter that always had the bargaining position. Nigeria needs Twitter and not the other way around. We have wasted seven months of our time as a nation pursuing an imaginary outcome against a global tech giant with a market cap bigger than Nigeria’s annual federal budget.” \n",
      "The Buhari regime had suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria on June 4, 2021, after the micro-blogging platform deleted a controversial civil war post by the President. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had said the “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence”.\n",
      "According to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool, Nigeria’s economy lost N104.02m ($250,600) every hour to the ban on Twitter as of December 2021.\n",
      "The regime, however, said it has lifted the suspension, effective January 13, 2022.\n",

      "But Adeyanju said it is shameful for members of the regime to return to the social media platform after suppressing free speech. Read Also Garba Shehu under fire over first post after Twitter returnsNigeria better with conditions met, Keyamo returns to TwitterTwitter reacts as operations resume in Nigeria after 222 days' suspension \n",
      "He said, “It is indeed shameful for President Buhari, Garba Shehu and others to return to Twitter after subverting the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the Twitter Ban and returning to the same platform they denied Nigerians from using for many months. The ban had no place in law and was a clear violation of section 39 rights of Nigerians.\n",
      "“The Twitter ban in the first place is an anti-democratic act, it is unconstitutional, has no basis in law because our constitution has made explicit provision that Nigerians have the right to express themselves and have the right to hold opinion and receive information. So, the ban was a contravention of the rights of Nigerians on social media, especially on Twitter.”\n",
      "The activist also said the ban and its lifting have already portrayed Nigeria in bad light among the comity of nations, adding that the development would affect the human rights index of the country.\n",
      "“There should not only be freedom of speech but freedom after speech,” he said.\n",
      "Nigeria has over 33 million active social media users. WhatsApp is the most popular platform used in the country, with over 90 million users according to Statista. About 61.4 per cent of Nigerian social media users use Twitter, 86.2 per cent use Facebook, 81.6 per cent use YouTube, 73.1 per cent use Instagram, and 67.2 per cent use Facebook Messenger.\n",

      "Some students of the University of Abuja on Wednesday in separate interviews with The PUNCH lamented the decision of the school authorities to increase their tuition fees. This is as some of the students took to popular micro-blogging platform, Twitter, to lament the increment which was described as both ”unfair” and  ”unjust” in protest.\n",
      "According to a student who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, some of them had been struggling to gather money for payment of the former fees due to the economic situation in the country but were shocked to learn of the new hike in fees.\n",
      "“Some of us are still struggling to make sure that our fees are complete and then we heard of the increment. There is economic hardship in this country. Where do they expect us to get the money to pay? Some of the people who spoke to the Vice Chancellor said the school explained that they needed money to construct some buildings; who will use the buildings if we cannot pay our school fees?”\n",
      "Another student also lamented the constant increment in fees which she claimed was also experienced in 2020.\n",
      "“The fees were increased in 2020. The funny thing is that new students have two weeks to pay. This is a federal university and not a private school, why is the school always increasing its fees?\n",
      "A student who also lamented his plight on Twitter via @akashi68 said, “Third time in a row, University of Abuja has and continues to increase school fees, adding 10k to every session, I paid 27k later paid 37k, now it is 47k”.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the spokesperson for the university, Dr. Habib Yakoob, when contacted by our correspondent, explained that the increment was a slight one. He explained that the university could no longer depend on the government for funds.\n",
      "He said, “The increment is not that significant; it was a slight increment but you see, no matter what anybody says, there would not be enough justification for why it is increased because even one kobo might not be affordable for our students. So, we sympathise with them but do remember that even some of our lecturers and other members of staff also have their children here, So, everybody is involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The University of Abuja is driving towards being a world-class university; a lot of developments have been taking place. We cannot also rely on the government for funds for the good things that the vice chancellor, the university management will want to carry out. So many projects and development are going on. So, with all of these, it requires some money and everybody is being taxed, not only the students. And it is just a slight review. There were consultations, it is not that the vice chancellor just woke up and decided to increase the fees,” he said.\n",

But the situation is different since we started witnessing the surrender of the terrorists. Areas under cultivation have increased by seven hundred per cent and farmers have had bumper harvests this year. \n",
      "“Whether we like it or not, we have to welcome these repentant Boko Haram insurgents. Although some of them may not be genuine, quite a number of them are genuine. Relative peace is gradually returning to the state as such we should encourage them to surrender not incite the locals against them.\n",
      "“Out of the over 20,000 that have surrendered, about 5,000 of them are fighters. So imagine the destructions these fighters would cause if they haven’t surrendered.

      "Speaking on the mega school premises in the Muna area of Jere Local Government Area of the state, the governor said it is beyond coincidence for a school that has no form of electrical connections to blow up in fire if not for human action as such his government will make concerted efforts to unearth the source of the fire.\n",
      "He said, “This school was commissioned by President Mohammadu Buhari barely six months ago. The government has spent a huge amount of money but unfortunately, it has been completely razed down.\n",
      "“Preliminary investigations show that there is some level of sabotage because I see no reason why a school like this which has not been connected to the national grid, no NEPA no generator, no nothing, you just see fire at the last floor of the building.” \n",
      "According to the principal of the school, Saidu Umaru, 19 classrooms and three laboratories were razed down by the fire on Monday morning, the first day of the school resumption.

      "The students’ wing of the Coalition of Northern Groups on Wednesday protested against the increase in school fees and other levies across tertiary institutions in the North.\n",
      "While giving the government three weeks ultimatum to address the issue to avoid “speaking” to it in the language it understands, the body warned that except stringent measures were put in place to check the increase, the number of girls who would drop out of school would increase.\n",
      "The national coordinator of CNG (Students Wing), Jamilu Aliyu, who raised the issues during a press conference in Abuja said institutions such as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi in the North-East; Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in the North-West; all with over 100 per cent increase in school fees and Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai in Niger State in the North-Central with over 60 per cent increase was very worrisome.\n",
      "He said, “The CNG-SW is disturbed by reports from its State chapters of an attempt by the federal and state governments to commercialize education to make it the exclusive preserve of treasury looters at the expense of children of millions of less-privileged Nigerians. \n",
      "“If the fee hike is not reviewed downward, it may force many students to drop out of school and increase social vices, as students may be compelled to survive by all means. We, therefore, urge the government at all levels to revert to the old fee to enable students from poor and marginalised families to access tertiary education and break the chain of poverty.\n",
      "“Finally, while we appeal to the students to be law abiding and not to the take law into their own hands in the quest to seek reversal of the fee increase, we equally pray that the government will listen to the cries of innocent Nigerian students within three weeks to avoid speaking in a language that the government understands best.  All state coordinators should be on alert for further directives from the national secretariat.\n",
      "“There are institutions such as ATBU Bauchi in the North-East, ABU Zaria in the North-West all with over 100 per cent increase and IBB University In the North-Central with over 60 per cent Increase. The CNG Students’ Wing, hereby condemns, in the strongest terms, the hike in tuition fees as an untimely, immoral, unconscionable, height of insensitivity and unacceptable attempt to deny the children of the poor access to affordable education, entrench class dichotomy and widen the gap between the rich and the poor.\n",

      "“We find it ridiculous and sad that stakeholders, particularly the lawmakers, cannot summon the courage to speak or stand with the people that sacrificed so much to see them in office at this trying time to demand an immediate reversal in the hike.”\n",
      "“When people who are elected into offices are indifferent or afraid to speak up for what is right and just, then the situation is hopeless. It’s unfortunate, that people in government today who are major beneficiaries of the magnanimity and foresight of past Nigerian leaders in the provision of quality, accessible readily available and affordable education are today the same people working to deprive other generations of the same privileges.\n",
      "“It’s currently predicted that more girls will drop out of school following the current economic hardship, unemployment, poverty and insecurity which is crippling most of the commercial activities, particularly in Northern Nigeria. It’s worrisome that this was coming at a time when promoting girls education was at the front burner of global discourse, especially in developing countries.\n",
      "“This singular act has not showcased government’s responsiveness towards promoting inclusive education. This is disheartening to all well-meaning Nigerians and we urge the government to reconsider and rescind its decision,” Aliyu added.\n",

      "“Further, we view the recent extra-judicial comment made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in a media chat he had with two journalists about the pending trial of our client with circumspection. We firmly believe that the comment approximates a taunt. To forestall any undesirable consequence that may eventuate on it, we consider it expedient that truly democratic institutions of the world send representatives to observe proceedings of the trial of our client.\n",
      "“We firmly believe that the presence of those representatives in court would make all parties tow the path of honour and rectitude and assure the fair trial of our client.\n",
      "In view of the foregoing, and anticipating your indulgence, may we then respectfully request you to forward to us the name of at least a representative, to enable us formally notify the court of his expected presence in court on the adjourned dates.\n",
      "“We also wish to use this opportunity to appeal to the United Nations to prevail on the Nigerian Government to caution her security agents. They should exhibit a modicum of civility in their operations and must refrain from harassing, intimidating, and or arresting innocent civilians who may throng the court premises on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January, 2022, in demonstration of their unwavering solidarity to our client. \n",

It is also on record that, notwithstanding the fact that these civilians have always been peaceful in their conduct and show of solidarity, the security agents have continued to harass intimidate and arrest them. Many of these persons so arrested are still languishing in various detention facilities in Nigeria.”\n",

      "The Indigenous People of Biafra has accused the Department of State Services of subjecting Nnamdi Kanu to 23-hour solitary confinement daily at its headquarters in Abuja.\n",
      "This is just as the group also alleged that the presiding judge in Kanu’s case, Justice Binta Nyako, was turning a blind eye to the impunity of the DSS against its leader.\n",
      "The group reminded both the judge and the DSS that solitary confinement of an innocent person is a crime as stipulated under Section 2 of the Anti-torture Act of 2017, which offence attracts 25 years imprisonment upon conviction.\n",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said Justice Nyako had refused to ensure that DSS oblige and respect the fundamental rights of Kanu as provided in the rule of law. \n",
      "Powerful also explained that a judge should be fair to all especially the accused who has not been convicted, adding that Kanu should not be treated with brutality simply because he is an Igbo.\n",
      "The statement read in parts, “Once again, we wish to raise the alarm over the continuous detention of our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, in solitary confinement at the State Security Services, headquarters Abuja.\n",
      "“We have seen that the presiding judge handling this case, Hon. Justice Binta Nyako is an accomplice to the suffering of an innocent man, who committed no crime known to law in Nigeria and the world. The judge has refused to ensure that the DSS oblige and respect the fundamental rights of Nnamdi Kanu as provided in the law.\n",

Nnamdi Kanu is being held in solitary confinement for 23 hours every day where he is daily being subjected to mental and emotional torture because of his belief in Biafra freedom and independence.\n",
      "“The fact that all orders made by the court presided over by Justice Binta Nyako about the welfare and management of Kanu at the DSS dungeon were all flouted by the detaining authority, without being reprimanded or committed for contempt by the presiding judge.\n",
      "“We are calling on men and women of good conscience, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, intersociety and reputable Human Rights Organisations across the globe to prevail on Nigeria government and the compromised security agencies particularly the DSS, as well as justice Binta Nyako to release Nnamdi Kanu whose health condition needs urgent attention.\n",

      "The new deadline for the registration on the portal is now Saturday, January 22, 2022.\n",
      "“With this extension, the NPF recruitment portal will remain open till midnight of the new date,” Police Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n",
      "He said, “The extension of the online application is informed by the need to ensure equal opportunity and even spread of applications, particularly from States in the South-East, South-South geopolitical zones and Lagos State, to enable them meet up with the required quota for their respective areas. A statistical analysis shows that a total of 81,005 applications were received nationwide as of January 7, 2022. Out of this figure, only 1,404 applications – less than 2 per cent of the total applications – were received from the five states in the South-East and 261 from Lagos State, with Anambra State having the least figure of 158 applicants. \n",
      "“Consequently, the Force enjoins states and local governments, religious bodies and other interest groups in the affected Geopolitical zones and Lagos State to assist in mobilizing and encouraging their citizens and wards to take advantage of the opportunity to seek a career path in the Nigeria Police Force. Interested applicants are urged to log on to the NPF recruitment portal to register before the expiration of the new deadline.

      "The Nigeria Customs Service have seized 3,620 live ammunition cartridges in Kwara state, the Kwara Area Customs Commander, Comptroller Hussaini Ahmed, said on Wednesday.\n",
      "Displaying the ammunitions at the headquarters of the Command in Ilorin, Ahmed said they were seized in the new year at Bukuro in the Baruten Local Government Area of the state.\n",
      "Recall that the Joint Border Patrol Team Sector 3, North Central Zone of the Nigeria Customs Service covering Kwara, Kogi, Niger and Benue states intercepted 550 pump action gun cartridges in Adikpo junction, Benue State in December 2021.\n",
      "Ahmed said, “The Command is showcasing the strategic and remarkable seizures of a large quantity of ammunition packaged in 25 packs of 25 rounds each, contained in fourteen cartons, worth N1,444,000. This landmark seizure was made around the Bukuro axis of the Command. \n",
      "“Based on an intelligence report, the Command intercepted a Peugeot 504 vehicle with registration number AP 448 AKD. On searching the vehicle, it was found to contain a large number of pump-action cartridges suspected to be smuggled into the country. Section 149 of the Customs and Excise Management Act of April 1958 Cap 45 LFN 2004 (as amended) gives Customs officers powers to search vehicles/ships.\n",
      "Ahmed who said that ammunition was classified under schedule 4 of Absolute Prohibition List of the Common External Tariff of the Nigeria Customs Service noted that “This epic seizure is very commendable at the backdrop of the heightened insecurity in the country.\n",
      "“Should 3,620 rounds of live ammunition of this magnitude find its way into the country and fall into the wrong hands, the result would be appalling, devastating and disastrous.”\n",

      "On revenue, the Controller disclosed that the Command generated a total sum of N19.159 billion between July 2019 and December 2021 which had been paid to the federation account.\n",

      "Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, on Wednesday, criticised former President Olusegun Obasanjo, for saying that oil found in the Niger Delta region constitutionally belonged to Nigeria.\n",
      "Adebanjo, at a press briefing in Lekki, Lagos, expressed disappointment that 84-year-old Obasanjo cited Nigeria’s “flawed” constitution to make the “provocative statement” with “magisterial authority”.\n",
      "The 93-year-old Afenifere leader also unequivocally backed 94-year-old leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Ijaw National Congress, Chief Edwin Clark, that people oil produced in the Niger Delta states belonged to the people of the region and not to the people of Nigeria.\n",
      "Adebanjo’s speech was titled, ‘Obasanjo provocative statement, catalyst to Nigeria’s breakup: Niger Delta resources don’t belong to Nigeria’. \n",
      "He went on a trip down memory lane and gave a perspective on constitutional evolution in Nigeria, insisting that the current 1999 Constitution must be changed to reflect fiscal federalism, regional autonomy and resource control.\n",
      "The nonagenarian said, “Before the issue degenerates therefore into disputation between two respectable elder statesmen (Obasanjo and Clark), I owe a duty to our founding fathers to throw some light on the historical constitutional evolution of the country to help us move Nigeria forward.\n",
      "“With my recent interaction with Gen. Obasanjo, I can appreciate his passion for a united Nigeria. But a united Nigeria does not exist from his own perspective and understanding only. Nigeria has existed before he became the President of the country with our founding fathers with equally great passion if not greater passion for a united Nigeria.\n",

      "“Our colonial masters brought the various ethnic nationalities together through various constitutional reforms under a unitary form of government from 1914 to 1950 under Macpherson Constitution when Nigeria was divided into three regions namely Northern Region, Western Region and Eastern Region.\n",
      "“The Macpherson Constitution which was supposed to last five years under a unitary system collapsed in 1953 following a motion by the late Chief Anthony Enahoro for self-government for Nigeria in 1956. The then Colonial secretary Sir. Oliver Lyttleton later known as Lord Chandos summoned the political leaders, our founding fathers, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Chief Obafemi Awolowo to Lancaster House in London.

      "“It was at this conference that the defects in Macpherson Unitary Constitution were dissected and they settled for a Federal Constitution which became operative in 1954 with the establishment of the three autonomous regions headed by a Premier.\n",
      "“The provision of this Federal Constitution with some amendments was incorporated in the 1960 and 1963 Independence Constitution. The residual powers in the constitution reserved for the federating autonomous regions. Revenue allocation was agreed to be on derivation which you now refer to as resource control with the payment of 50% (section 140, 1963 Constitution) to the region where the revenue was derived. It was a two tier Federal system with the State government being co-ordinate and not subordinate to the Federal Government.\n",
      "“This was the peaceful co-existence position of the unity of the ethnic groups until 1966 when the military took over the government and abrogated the constitution agreed to by our founding fathers and set up the present 1999 constitution. The obnoxious provisions of this constitution have been the cause of instability in the country.”\n",
      "Continuing, Adebanjo added, “When General Obasanjo asserts that the Niger Delta Resources is not owned by Niger Delta but Nigeria, is the General suggesting that God created the resources in Niger Delta when Nigeria came into existence in 1914, or it was there before the amalgamation?\n",
      "“It is the amalgamation and the decision of our founding fathers to live together under the conditions agreed to in Independence Constitution that make other parts of Nigeria to lay claim to the resources of Niger Delta. The question of the protection of Niger Delta resources against external forces by the Federal government is not a big deal but a responsibility assigned to the Federal Government under the Federal System.\n",

      "Agency Report \n",
      "Published 12 January 2022\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Anthony Fauci called Kansas Senator Roger Marshall a “moron” on Tuesday after a tense exchange over Fauci’s financial disclosures, a sign of the increasing hostility between conservatives and one of the nation’s top COVID-19 experts.\n",
      "Toward the end of a more-than-three-hour Senate Health Committee meeting, Marshall pointed to Fauci’s government salary of more than 400,000 dollars and asked whether he would make his financial disclosure available to the public.\n",
      "Fauci is a government employee and his financial disclosure forms are available to the public and can be accessed through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n",
      "“Wouldn’t you agree with me that you see things before members of Congress would see them, so that there’s an air of appearance that maybe some shenanigans are going on? \n",
      "“I assume that’s not the case,” Marshall said.\n",
      "When Fauci called Marshall “misinformed” and said his financial disclosure was public information and available upon request, Marshall said his office had been unable to find the information.\n",
      "As Kansas Senator Jerry Moran prepared to ask a question, Fauci was caught on the microphone saying “what a moron” and “Jesus Christ.”\n",

      "In a press release after the hearing, Marshall doubled down and said Fauci was “clearly distraught by the line of questioning.”\n",
      "“Calling me a moron during a Senate hearing may have alleviated the stress of the least trusted bureaucrat in America, but it didn’t take away from the facts,” Marshall said.\n",
      "The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which was headed by Fauci, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "Fauci was testifying with Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centres for Disease Control, and Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "He said about the current surge of COVID-19 cases spreading through the country as a result of the Omicron variant.\n",
      "Throughout the pandemic, Fauci has been a target of conservatives who have chafed at the way the government has handled health restrictions.\n",
      "But nearly two years into the pandemic, tension has ratcheted up between Fauci and conservatives in Congress, where there was a partisan divide over who wore masks in the hallways and in the chamber.\n",

      "Senator Rand Paul, who has been a frequent critic, has called Fauci “a lead architect” of the government’s response to the virus, from shutting down businesses at the beginning of the pandemic to urging people to wear a mask and get vaccinated.\n",
      "Earlier in the committee hearing, Marshall, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, questioned Fauci about his role in authorising “gain of function” research, a type of experiment where scientists change a virus to make it more potent as a way to study its effects.\n",
      "Marshall has said he would like a ban on a gain of function research and has made investigating the origins of COVID-19 a core platform for his first year in office.\n",
      "Fauci also clashed with Paul over an email exchange between him and former director of the National Institutes of Health Francis Collins.\n",
      "In which Collins and Fauci discussed how to combat what they called a “fringe” narrative about the pandemic raised by epidemiologists at prestigious universities.\n",
      "In response, Fauci held up a print-out of Paul’s Senate campaign website, where there was a picture of Fauci next to the text “Fire Dr Fauci” and several buttons where people can make donations to the campaign.\n",
      "Fauci talked about how he has gotten death threats after similar exchanges with Paul and said a man who was arrested driving from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. with an AR-15 and ammunition said he was going there to kill Fauci.\n",

      "Members of ACT UP burned him in effigy outside of the NIH building during one protest.\n",

      "\n",
      "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a parliamentary reckoning Wednesday about another alleged breach of coronavirus rules that has prompted damning headlines and calls for him to quit.\n",
      "Johnson is under fierce pressure to say whether he attended a boozy gathering in the garden of his Downing Street residence in May 2020, in the midst of the country’s first strict lockdown.\n",
      "It follows a flurry of accusations about Downing Street parties held during lockdowns in 2020, which have dogged Johnson since late last year, sparking widespread public anger, sinking poll ratings and predictions he may have to resign — even from his own MPs.\n",
      "“If the prime minister knowingly attended a party I don’t see how he can survive, having accepted resignations for far less,” Conservative lawmaker Nigel Mills told the BBC.

      "Johnson, elected by a landslide in December 2019, will be quizzed for the first time on the latest claims by opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer and other MPs at weekly parliamentary questions from noon (1200 GMT).\n",
      "The 57-year-old has stonewalled the issue since an email was leaked late Monday in which a senior official invited more than 100 colleagues to the event on May 20, 2020, encouraging them to “bring your own booze”.\n",
      "Johnson and his wife Carrie attended the gathering, according to anonymous witnesses quoted in the media, intensifying public anger from a time when millions were obediently respecting the lockdown rules.\n",
